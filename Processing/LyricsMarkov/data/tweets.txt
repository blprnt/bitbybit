Great visualization of last.fm genre usage in Europe, built in Processing: http://visualizinglastfm.de/ Just ordered 8 XBees - to make a few wireless NewsAlarms. It's interesting to see so many complex Twitter meta-tools rushing to make sense of such an intrinsically simple medium. @mezzoblue - At least the Chili Peppers has stopped... I hope? @harrisj Is the Etsy API public yet? I hadn't heard about it for a while... "Well, hey, I didn't spend all those years playing Dungeons and Dragons and not learn a little something about courage."

Expect to see something tomorrow. @kalisurfer I love the faceted searching of the NYT API - lets me do more with less calls. But the Guardian has fulltext - which is great. Rendering these new video visualizations of NYT API data requires so many calls it’s time for a caching system, I think... @harrisj Hopefully I will make it to NYC soon - maybe next month, if all goes well... @harrisj Unfortunately not - though I would love to be.

 (featuring @sgentiluomo) Hmmm... the NYTimes Article Search API is throwing me 504 errors like they are going out of style. Looking for a stat on how many public tweets are sent by the entire Twitter user base per day. Anyone have a lead?

I'll admit- I'm only really jealous that I'm not at Schwartzs having a sandwich. @twgonzalez I may make an edition (at a smaller size!) and the original will be for sale. This morning is a morning of meetings. This afternoon is an afternoon of working on a 30' print. Should balance out nicely. Like @cshirky, I've often thought about how lucky I am that Facebook wasn't around in University. http://is.gd/DmtV Strange mix of work today - a 30' long print, a playground, and a wireless news alarm.

Cutlery venn diagram - I can never find a knork when I need one! http://bit.ly/5pmaD Getting back to the NYTimes Article Search API for some really big prints I'll be showing at the Data Art Show - http://pinkhobo.com/?p=9 It appears that PImage.get(x,y,w,h) in OpenGL returns a PImage with blank pixels. To copy a chunk of pixels, I had to move them one by one. Strange processing behaviour - get(x,y,w,h) is returning a PImage full of grey (#CCCCCC) pixels instead of what is on the screen - ideas?

Great data explorations in a museum context - http://museumpipes.wordpress.com/ @richvanvoorst It will if I run a render in the next couple of days! Starting to see some progress with evolved path systems. The very tip of the project's iceberg, but a tip nonetheless. I often say after I'm finished that I enjoy a difficult project more than a simple one. That sentiment is more elusive in the middle of one. Generating paths- the kind you walk on.

Thanks for all of the help - issue seems to be sorting itself out. Not happy with support at 1and1, though. Now back to our regular program.

Finally got the video upload going. Opened the vid in QT and just re-saved it out. Now waiting on the 3hr upload. @flight404 You are truly a craftsman of subtlety. @creativeapps Apparently that doesn't work for HD... @flight404 Once again you miss out on the subtle Canadian innuendo. @SteveMynett Games are officially ON. Bring your radio!! @flight404 Easy there... you'll make the igloo melt. @jimmwagner It's a .MOV - 1280x720. Same exact setup as the last ones... just bigger. @flight404 I suppose it could be something to do with the explicit sexual content that I edited into the middle... @SteveMynett Fields are in pretty good shape - but they won't be if we play on them in the muck too much! Vimeo upload is choking on my 537MB HD video - it completes early every time (30 seconds in) then goes to a broken vid. Any ideas? @sermad Ah yes - it was morning over here! @SteveMynett I'm with you. I sure like to throw a frisbee, but I could do without it tonight. Luckily I have a waterproof radio... Watching Stephen Wolfram in this video makes me seasick - he sways back and forth like he's on a boat - http://is.gd/vO07 Added 'Gerade in' to the JustLanded search phrases (thanks, @tocame_munich!) @cforster- I only make ~10 Twitter queries / 24 hour period (user locs are scraped from HTML).

The internet is broken in our hotel during Internet Week NY (yes, it is the official hotel. no, I'm not here for internet week) For those who have asked about the map in Just Landed - it's a B&W version of this image from the NASA Earth Observatory - http://is.gd/OdVn I was just listed in an e-mail as Jed Thorpe - I wonder if the sender really meant me, or some long-lost hillbilly cousin? They are testing the fire alarm system in our hotel room - for a second I thought that aliens had landed. Disappointment. @qomop Yes - it's certainly a project with some practical problems! Arduino 0016 is out, with what looks like minor changes - http://bit.ly/3zAIn And thus concludes my short review of cool stuff I saw when @shiffman showed me around ITP. Thanks, Daniel!

New release of #processing audio utils from @toxi - http://code.google.com/p/toxiclibs/downloads/list Nice to see that Milan's excellent Density Design Lab is on twitter - @densitydesign. Well worth a follow for those interested in info viz. " A day like all days, filled with those events that alter and illuminate our times. And you were there." RIP Walter Cronkite. @HerRadar Not sure... I imagine it will be in the September issue (out in August). I'll post the final graphic on my blog.

I just spent an hour going through Bill Atkinson's (yes, that Bill Atkinson) geological & nature photographs - http://is.gd/2Im23 Didn't realize that stats on @vimeo video pages only show plays from vimeo.com- the 'see referrers' stats show embedded plays. Todd Holloway's blog hasn't been updated in a while, but is a good infoviz resource - http://abeautifulwww.com/ DVD of the legendary 1966 collaborations between NY artists (Rauschenberg, Cage, Rainer...) & Bell Labs engineers- http://www.9evenings.org/ @amishare quite possibly wins the 'Best First 13 Tweets Ever' award. Many great finds in there, including this: http://is.gd/2I1dt Manuel Lima publishes a manifesto: http://bit.ly/lSNqp A bit of a time warp tonight - going to see a band that I used to see every Sunday for two years. @mezzoblue I've heard that from a few people. I am holding off on Snow Leopard for a few months - hopefully they will have fixed it by then! Beautiful generative branding work for onedotzero from @sermad & @toxi -  http://vimeo.com/6312503 Wow. @hascanvas (http://is.gd/2CPsJ) lets you write & run Processing sketches in the browser. Could make a great teaching tool. via@mtchl Dennis is a frequent collaborator (Glocal, NewsAlarm) & an excellent artist in many media. Talk is part of HUB project: http://is.gd/2CvD7 Hey Vancouver: Dennis Rosenfeld is giving an artist talk tonight at 7pm @UBC Robson Square, Room C485. Building a blog & wiki for code.lab, the project I'll be working on for the next 6 months, in residence at Emily Carr University. Looks like GapMinder (http://graphs.gapminder.org/) is built in Flash, with a custom tool called Trendalyzer (http://is.gd/2C8wA) Hans Rosling shows some very compelling data tools in today's TED Talk- http://is.gd/2C89l - I wonder what platform they were built with? @bit101 Yes, I often confuse Mario with the clergy! Must be his humble demeanor. And constant prayer. Somehow, in the tide of bad news we hear every day, I find this very disturbing - the axolotl is verging on extinction: http://is.gd/2AU7Y @infosthetics I don't blame anyone for re-using content. It just seems common courtesy to put a prominent attribution. @mtchl Ah, yes. I didn't see that. Still, how hard would it be to write some original text? Amazing how some blog writers will copy and paste content from others with no attribution at all- http://is.gd/2AuV3 from http://is.gd/2AuVE @mslima & Michelle Borkin start discussions about a TEDViz community - http://is.gd/2AcTt http://is.gd/2AcTQ Text visualization of 11 seconds of Twitter traffic, from @apenasisso - http://bit.ly/KT0Ka From his 2005 Kenyon College commencement speech - http://bit.ly/IBhGu A huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded - David Foster Wallace In Yaletown. A 10 minute walk from my 'hood to an entirely different planet. With much smaller dogs. And more Budweiser umbrellas. I'll check it again when I get home this afternoon. Reading the decidedly non-entrepreneurial and quite fascinating story of Craig Newmark & craigslist - http://is.gd/2xqQm (via @palafo) Thinking about putting the GoodMorning! app online w/source code. Testing it in a browser... In case you want to make your own Good Morning visualization - 10,330 tweets w/ latlon: http://www.blprnt.com/transfer/goodmorning.txt Surprisiest of surprises: my 3-month dealings with the BC provincial govt. on an Olympic project have ended in a tangle of incompetence. 9 new Processing libraries, including computer vision, text-to-speech, polygon unwrapping & arduino - http://is.gd/2wMNE (via @REAS) @jennifergardy http://bit.ly/3O1kaC If you're going to post somebody else's image in your Flickr stream, I think it's common courtesy to provide a link to the original. Matthew Hurst's (@matthewhurst) maps of the blogosphere are a bit old but very interesting - http://is.gd/2wFWb. Good Morning! Thanks for all of the overnight re-tweets and blog posts (I'm looking at you, @creativeapps, @infosthetics & @datavis) GoodMorning! visualizes 11,000 wake-up tweets from around the globe over 24 hours. Watch the world wake up: http://ow.ly/l3BE New blog post: Watch the world wake up - GoodMorning! visualizes 11,000 morning tweets from around the globe- http://is.gd/2vYj7 @JohnathonV I'd wager whoever designed that logo is into crystals. @mezzoblue But for now, I think I'll head to the Alibi. @mezzoblue I think I'll do a render with the cloud layer moving in the other direction. Still lots of things to improve... @mezzoblue The cloud layer drifts at a slightly different speed. The 'earth' layer should be static. Should. Apologies for the private vimeo link - all fixed now. http://www.vimeo.com/6215825 A first render from a new project called 'GoodMorning!', visualizing morning tweets from around the globe - http://www.vimeo.com/6215825 There are more interesting things to be found in Kim's photostream - http://www.flickr.com/photos/kimasendorf/ Augenkrebs from Kim Asendorf -- "You can just watch them to get entertained or to get something like eye cancer." - http://is.gd/2scml It's fairly depressing to run http://www.twitblock.org/ - it seems about 200 of my followers smell at least faintly of pork. Blocking away! @mariuswatz Excellent! I hadn't seen that. Very articulate article by Melissa McEwan on the damaging effects of 'casual mysogyny' (which I see a lot of on Twitter)- http://is.gd/2s3IE I can't think of a better cause than the one championed by SherylWuDunn & @nytimeskristof's Half the Sky- http://is.gd/2rbP9 @flight404 I like how you jump from being Robert to Roger in this article - http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/23187/page2/ @Campagnolomain I'm always craving ceci. Not sure if I can make it down tonight, but I'll see you soon enough! @Campagnolomain That certainly looks like the tail end of a Ling Cod...! New Processing workshop dates- Introduction to Processing:  Sept. 12, Processing for Web Developers: Oct. 3. More info: http://is.gd/2qC6T @mezzoblue Data typing is definitely the worst part. println(1/4) is always a nice way to start confusing people. And yes - lets do beers. I just overwrote (for the second time) a data file that took 24 hours to gather. 48 hours wasted in 3 days. Curses. @mezzoblue has been making excellent progress with #processing, and documenting the experience at http://exnihilo.mezzoblue.com/ OFFF is in Paris in 2010 - June 24/25/26 http://www.offf.ws/ Heading over for some neighbourly porch-sitting with @cbrumelle and family. Perfect night for it. @JeffClark has made some clever time series graphs from word usage in Tweets - http://is.gd/2p09V (via @wattenberg) I finished Infinite Jest for @infinitesummer a month early - giving me 30 days to figure out what the &*!@% actually happened in this book. Typo in that last tweet - Mundaneum, not Munaneum. Sorry, M. Otlet. Reading about Belgian thinker Paul Otlet and his Munaneum - a repository for all the world's knowledge (in 1934) - http://is.gd/2oLeG Sign the petition calling for an official apology for the persecution of Alan Turing - http://is.gd/2oF2w (via @generatorx) ATTN: Design students - http://bit.ly/iPLsY @WiredUK is full of goodies this morning - Can you bill restaurants for time you spent in them? http://is.gd/2owag @WiredUK has a good take on Augmented Stuff on a Screen - http://is.gd/2ow0v @mtchl Yes - documentation will follow, for sure. Once this epically long project is actually done. http://twitpic.com/edvj0 - Success at creating a contour map from a 3D mesh. Implementing a contouring algorithm ported from C++, ported from FORTRAN. Which is good, because I was just thinking I could use a headache. Make your own crime scene - Israeli scientists show how to spoof DNA tests - http://is.gd/2lKMv (via @harrisj) @kilozebra It's a regular grid. Anyone have any advice for generating a contour map from 3D mesh points? Preferably in Java/Processing? @hoobert has been extracting data from huge amounts of Tweets - like this list of the top 30 sites visited via Twitter- http://is.gd/2ki2C Voxel Ville - cubist renderings of dublin from high-grade aerial laser scans - http://www.field.io/process/research/science/voxelville Interesting comment on my Twitter analysis post -  how editing activity on Wikipedia can be analyzed for user info- http://is.gd/2iEXW Queueing up this panel discussion with @timoreilly about making the web work for science- http://is.gd/2hifV - but for now it's the weekend! @pitchinteractiv How far west are you coming? Here's a nice feature on my very funny & talented friends from @wearepuny, in Minnesota Monthly - http://is.gd/2h2cO I wonder if the Svalbard Science Centre has an Artist in Residence program? If so, sign me up. http://is.gd/2h0EM @palafo This one shows your tweets/day - http://bit.ly/XL2UB @palafo The grey line shows the time of your first tweet in a day - on vacation you were tweeting later! http://www.flickr.com/p/6PuvbH Kyle McDonald's entry for Tiny Sketch is cheeky *and* beautiful - http://bit.ly/14TFxp Posted a few 'Twittergrams' showing twitter usage patterns for some people that I follow: @cshirky, @TEDchris, @palafo - http://is.gd/2girY Argh. I really really thought the #emd18 grad show was tomorrow. Very disappointed to have missed this event - what an excellent group. Twitter is changing the way you retweet - http://bit.ly/MS3EJ New blog post - Too much information? Twitter, Privacy, and Lawrence Waterhouse: http://is.gd/2fQTg @nickbilton Coincidence? Or conspiracy? BusinessWeek features '21 Heroes of Data Visualization' - http://is.gd/2flQg - seriously? Heroes? I feel like I should be rescuing puppies. Ken Lim has built a high-fiving twitter-enabled robot - http://is.gd/2flHt @openplatform - here's a high five @guardianrobot - #highfive At the alibi room, after an epic day of battle with the Twitter API. @sebleedelisle will pay your parking ticket! Certainly the most generous Twitter mashup I've seen so far! http://is.gd/2e9sC Algorithmic Trading: A Primer (PDF)  ---   http://bit.ly/l1Fkr
 (via @rostoker) I wonder if spam filters look at grammar & punctuation? If not, they should. Mitchell Whitelaw's Visible Archive project is an excellent example of open art - http://visiblearchive.blogspot.com/ @tangibleint has posted the first video of their custom 20x112 LED matrix with onboard controller- looks amazing! http://vimeo.com/6059965 If I were you, and I didn't have a ticket for @FOTB in Brighton this September, I'd hurry up and buy one before they inevitably sell out. That was a long and winding day, no matter how you choose to pronounce it. growth modeling device does the same thing, but using a fuse deposition modeler - http://www.dwbowen.com/gmd.html David Bowen's growth rendering device produces drawings of a pea plant as it grows, thrives, and dies- http://is.gd/2aQWc -via @infosthetics @evianrd sent me this fantastic link of Diegi Stocco creating music from a tree - http://bit.ly/hhm5A Old fashioned DIY - homemade windmills from Nebraska: http://is.gd/2aFbI (thanks, @alexismadrigal!) The speaker list for Artangel's 12 hour relay debate on long-term themes is amazing - http://is.gd/2aBpn - too bad I'll miss it by a week. Dangers of working with the Twitter API - accidentally following 500 people. Luckily unfollowing was reasonably easy. Thinking about Twitter, mornings, and Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse. Interesting things are afoot. Excellent interview with Ben Fry - http://bit.ly/NL3JW Joel Baumann's @FOTB session looks interesting - http://bit.ly/XVlVv I think many math educators could do well using Denis Guedj's The Parrot's Theorum as a textbook- http://is.gd/273KJ The discussion thread on this #TED talk hosts a fascinating discussion on math & education. - http://is.gd/273BN (via @tensafefrogs) @openprocessing and @Rhizomedotorg are running a Processing sketch competition - 200 chars or less. http://is.gd/273sn Looks like I will be in the UK from September 20th - 28th. Brighton for @FOTB, and then London for a few days. I am currently working on the 41st compiled version of this evolutionary landscape design tool. Lucky 41? Excellent article on @cdmblogs about the PS3 Eye, with detailed instructions about using it for computer vision projects- http://is.gd/25yzV Self-employment is not friendly to vacations - neither is ubiquitous wifi.  I have worked every day so far on my 'holiday'. Curses. Everyone likes a science mega-project, but "really good science can be done on a much smaller scale"-  http://is.gd/25erj (via @joergheber) @jennifergardy #17 is 'I just got a DM from Jack Hodgins'. @MargaretLAtwood Good luck with Wordpress! It's friendlier than it may at first seem... @Quasimondo Zowee! Gosh! Interesting overview from @infosthetics of Steve Duenes' keynote at #siggraph - http://is.gd/23PZc @twgonzalez I'm quite certain that Just Landed had something to do with it - though curiously neither book has asked me to talk about it. #352 on my list of things I thought I'd never say - I'm now following Margaret Atwood on Twitter (@margaretlatwood) I've been invited to contribute to 2 excellent Data Visualization books in as many weeks - very exciting. I'll share more news when I can. @golan has announced some preliminary details about ART && CODE- a symposium on mobile, locative and networked media: http://artandcode.com/ How to factor 90% of infinity - http://www.flickr.com/photos/davebollinger/3792396634/ I'm digging the scratch input & touchable holography interfaces - http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/editors/23940/ (via @golan) I quite like some of the abstract generative work in Gwen Vanhee's photostream - http://www.flickr.com/photos/hildeengwenverbouwen/ @quasimondo updates his prime number discoveries and asks for mathematicians to fact check. Any takers? - http://is.gd/22pNB Loving the math geekiness going on over here - http://www.flickr.com/photos/quasimondo/3785322473/ Beautiful spiral data vis by Bestario - http://www.bestiario.org/research/spisi/ (via @andresw) Scientists use Twitter to measure the happiness of America - http://is.gd/21298 (via @wireduk) Math geeks take note - Mario Klingemann takes on  prime numbers & the mysteries of the universe! - http://is.gd/20MSx At 8pm, 33% of Americans are watching TV or movies. http://bit.ly/2VFiC8 Expect Twitter silence from me forthe next week or so - please DM anything important ( or very very funny) Great class this AM - 3D in Processing. Now headed to ECU code.lab for discussion on systems aesthetics and surveillance. Oct. 3rd Processing for Web Programmers workshop has been rescheduled to Saturday, Oct. 24th. There are still a few spots space available. Congrats to @creativeapps for putting the creation into creative! @ounodesign I brought home a magazine for you because it had that ad in it! It's on the table. @jaggeree sponsored by The Guardian? Is anyone in the UK running regular Processing workshops? I've had a few people enquire since #FOTB. @serial_consign Would love to hear the results you get from your request - I use agent-based sim in The Colour Economy: http://is.gd/3MKL6 Nice Processing hack from @mariuswatz to create non-standard (small, borderless, etc.) windows in Processing: http://is.gd/3MJ3M A very impressive list of prominent Canadians are speaking out against British Columbia's arts cuts: http://stopbcartscuts.ca/ Back in Vancouver - rather than sifting through these 1000s of unread tweets, I'm going to pretend they don't exist. Mark all as read. One extended day of travel tomorrow then back to Vancouver and a more regular Twitter schedule. I have some catch-up to do! Looking for a place to get dinner on a Sunday night near High Street Kensington. Any Londoners have ideas? Just visited Roger Hiorns' Seizure, a crystalized south London flat. Beautiful. @webponce Mark Lombardi Big thanks to @sermad for setting up my visit to W+K yesterday - and thanks to those who listened! Two more days in London. Going to see Seizure either today or tomorrow - http://is.gd/3GKAJ "train service to Liverpool st. Will be delayed due to a person under the train." Interesting post by @mslima on the dangerously short lifespans of digital data: http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/blog/ Long day in London today. Getting ready to do a lecture on collaboration for ECU in Vancouver via Skype. Sorry, hotel neighbours. Reminder: I am running a Processing for Web Developers workshop on Oct. 3 - good for those with some programming experience. DM for details. Peter Kirn has written two interesting posts about Processing: http://is.gd/3BZqq & http://is.gd/3BZr1 #fotb is done. I'd love to hear feedback/crticism/suggestions from those who were there for my presentation. Congrats to @mslima for getting the Visual Complexity book moving towards publication: http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/book/ @FOTB I was going to jump down from the Balcony to give you a hug on stage, but my superpowers aren't what they used to be. Doing a Skype call with my colleagues from code.lab in Vancouver - then heading out for one more evening in Brighton. I London tomorrow AM. Joa Ebert live-coded a 3D audio visualizer in 10 minutes at #fotb - in Processing. The view from the stage in Brighton, watching @gskinner get the short improv 'throwdown' sessions going http://yfrog.com/3o6wgoj @jenwell please contact @sebleedelisle - he wants to pay your parking ticket! He's not a freak. #fotb folks - I'll be presenting some work that I've never shown before at the Jam Session this afternoon at 1:30 in the dome. @quasimondo is showing some fantastic cellular automata systems built with pixel blender Getting settled in for @quasimondo's talk at #fotb. Nothing like math in the morning to get the brain moving. An article I wrote for @creativeapps has been posted - The HyperCard Legacy: Programming for the People | http://j.mp/fuMo2 This might be the closest I get to eating with Jamie Oliver - dinner at Jamie's Italian in Brighton. Something I forgot to mention - The Guardian has AS3 libraries for their content search API. Saw a great demo yesterday, will post link! @jonmacdonald Sure - I'll keep one for you. I also have some free prints to give out which I forgot to do - find me and I'll give you one (while they last) Thanks to everyone who attended my #fotb talk. I had to run after to see @toxi so had to miss questions. Please find me if you have any! On stage at #FOTB, sound-checking. This 16x9 projector is perfect for my HD Just Landed & GoodMorning! videos. I'm extremely excited to see @toxi speak tomorrow at #fotb. Join me after my talk - we will head over en masse. @jaggeree Yes - I'll be in London from the 24th to 28th! I will be talking about Mark Lombardi in my talk tomorrow at #FOTB as a lead in to discussion about the NYTimes APIs and data in general. I'm all settled in at Brighton for #FOTB. Going to go to the afternoon sessions after I get a bit of work done. Say hello if you see me! @mtchl Agreed. I've often thought about what Lombardi's work would look like if he had been a programmer. Ben Fry: "Too much work in visualization, or even at the more complicated end of information design is just showing us the index cards" I'm very interested to read Ben Fry's essay on Mark Lombardi: http://benfry.com/writing/archives/545 Finally getting into Brighton. I haven't had a good flight on Air Canada for a decade. Let's see if that will change with this one. I'm not holding my breath. Up at 4am Ottawa time after an excellent Quebecois wedding. Heading to Brighton for #FOTB. I think I will be the last one there. In Gatineau - having an excellent time trying to use at least 10% of my highschool french. Je m'appelle le Tick! I will be offline for the next 4 days - heading to a Wedding in Ottawa before #fotb. DM me with anything important! Do you want the high score? Destroying alien invaders in Mac game Lose/Lose also destroys your files: http://is.gd/3nEcO (via @creativeapps) Vancouver launched its open-data website today, with some data sets available for download: http://.data.vancouver.ca/  (via @xer0x) @kk Bad timing - I leave for the UK in the morning tomorrow! @kk Processing + MovieMaker library? That's what I do. There may be some easier ways but nothing immediately jumps to mind... Thanks to everyone who made the trek out to UBC tonight! @shadpetosky Parking ticket? Time to talk to Seb! Walter Koerner was clearly my kind of guy - he has both a library and a pub at UBC named after him. To answer a few questions: The talk tonight is free, open to anyone, and there's a pub right next door. One last reminder about my artist talk at UBC tonight - software art, science & hypercard : http://www.rilli.com/events/3099?simple One more reason Austin is an awesome town: http://austincreativecode.net/ If you've ever thought 'I wish there was a page with hundreds of links about art, science, tech & culture' - http://is.gd/3hDBk Stephen Wilson's new book 'Art+Science Now' will be out in March, 2010 - looks to be a good survey: http://is.gd/3hCDU In just over 202M years, Google will have eaten itself - http://www.gwei.org/ Had an idea last night to improve my NYTimes 360/365 graphics - it seems to be working quite well. Will post some results. @sermad I think that's proabably true - still, I thought I'd take the opportunity to complain about geographical certainties. Cursed time zones! Of course the ThisHappened event in London on the 25th is sold out, before I wake up. #thlon I'm shipping off some print tomorrow- I'd be happy to have to carry a few more to the post office! http://blprnt.etsy.com Quantum Computing for Highschool Students: http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/highschool.html I'm enjoying reading posts about mathematics and the singularity and many other things on Scott Aaronson's blog: http://is.gd/3eP5b Reading Bill Atkinson's presentation notes - 'Twenty Years With Mac' - http://is.gd/3eIcr Reminder to Vancouver folks: I will be giving an artist talk on Tuesday night in the Laserre Building at UBC: http://is.gd/3eGAi Oh, Flash 4 Actions Panel - do you remember the good times we had? Together with frame loops, in the park? http://is.gd/3enem Interesting to see a breadboard on the splash page for the Canada Council for the Arts: http://www.canadacouncil.ca/ Had a great group for my Introduction to Processing Workshop - thanks to everyone who attended. @mokafolio Yes - they run from Granville island back and forth across False Creek @flight404 Skipper says 12. Yes, that was just an excuse to say 'skipper'. My commuting vehicle for the next 6 months:http://yfrog.com/3oz64gj I missed an important detail about my talk on Tuesday at UBC - it is at 7PM, in Lassere rm 102. Vancouver folks: I am giving an artist talk next Tuesday at UBC, in  Laserre rm102. All are welcome - beers after.  http://is.gd/39YXr My apologies for sparse communications this week - I have barely had time to breathe. Expect a return to verbosity next week. Thanks to @serial_consign for his #dataviz survey on http://scienceblogs.com/revminds/ Datalibre.ca is a group blog advocating for open data in Canadian governments: http://datalibre.ca/ This is surreal - the actual letter sent by BC Minister Kevin Krueger to those complaining about Arts & Culture cuts: http://is.gd/37oXo RT @ben_fry: "Processing, meet Mozilla.

New Blog Post: BC Budget Visualizations - DIY Transparency & Local Government -- http://bit.ly/19r4CQ @shiffman Here is a list that I put together for a similar process: http://bit.ly/bIN9e Slate's News Dots visualization tool is 'Brought to you by Jack Daniels'.

Very actively involved in mag creation for a month: interns@wired.co.uk for details. @pitchinteractiv have created some fascinating conceptual visualizations based on my colour economy project - http://is.gd/2YDlO Processing 1.07 is posted, including Snow Leopard video fixes (probably) - http://processing.org/download/ (via @ben_fry) @ben_fry I heard that! Has anybody had experience with facial recognition algorithms (not face detection)? Wondering if there are any open source projects around. Nice! For the next few months @serial_consign will be posting at ScienceBlogs' "Revolutionary Minds Think Tank" blog - http://is.gd/2SOr1 @JoshuaDavis Giant shark throws up air tank & Robert Shaw, fixes boat, spits out a man, heals a boy, vomits out a drunk girl onto a beach Though I disagree in parts with @mslima's Manifesto there is no arguing that his work has made a HUGE contribution to the infoviz world. New piece by Ben Fry examines changes in editions of Darwin's On the Origin of Species. Elegant, and insightful: http://benfry.com/traces/ @mezzoblue Bomb threat at VCC. They are probably detonating in the park? I wonder if the CBC has a go-to list on file of people completely unqualified to speak on specific topics? @mslima continues discussion on his InfoViz manifesto: http://bit.ly/wx8fU RT @benhammersley: The new issue of Wired UK is out today.

Further thoughts on the infovis manifesto - http://is.gd/2OiZF - (via @mslima @BBHLabs) @ivncrz The next beginners' workshop is on Sept. 12  - the next will likely be on Oct. 17th (not confirmed) @davejohnson Likely the Processing for Web Developers (Oct. 3) would make the most sense... feel free to e-mail me with questions. Reminder: My next Intro to Processing workshop is on Sept. 12 in Vancouver. Learn how to be creative with code! DM me for details. @andremichelle linked to this excellent video - I show it to all of my students on the 1st day, to give context: http://is.gd/2NXlA @quasimondo has posted some interesting antique infographics from a 1966 Danish almanac - http://is.gd/2NWpP If I had 885 euros to spend on a clock, I'd probably spend it on one of these: http://qlocktwo.com/ Reading: Geoengineering the climate: A clear perspective from The Royal Society http://bit.ly/119fU3 (by @2020science) Listening to a podcast with Steven Shapin about Robert Boyle, Thomas Hobbes & the scientific revolution: http://is.gd/2LVgN @rtanglao We are at the GI campus. @pitchinteractiv No - it's working for me. @mezzoblue You may want to try OCD - http://www.gdsstudios.com/processing/libraries/ocd/ Uploading a pile of files for an upcoming info viz book. We'll see how many of them end up being used! @mezzoblue What are you using for camera placement? @pitchinteractiv No - that appears to be a hard limit. To get 24hrs of data, I had to leave a search client running for a day. @flowingdata Maybe he is looking for work as a counterfeiter? http://bit.ly/Cfx9l If there was a website called picturesofjellyfish.com, I'd visit it every day. Until then I'll have to make do with this: http://is.gd/2LtjM @rtanglao Sure - you should come by the lab at ECU. We'll happily buy the coffee. Interesting and very in-depth article on the history of Evolutionary Computation: http://is.gd/4JkD5 (by @geneticargonaut) Hockey and inforgraphics, together at last: http://www.flickr.com/photos/infojocks/4059124222/sizes/o/ (via @datavis) Wordnik.com has released an API - interesting. Not sure exactly how it could be used, but it's nice to have another data source. Congratulations to @JoshuaDavis and @waxpraxis on the release of HYPE - an AS3 framework for creative coding. http://hype.joshuadavis.com/ So far I've opened Google Wave once. Am I missing anything? @bjfresh Thanks for the conference link (http://is.gd/4IA2c)  - Galison and Ian Hacking! Don't know much about Naomi Oreskes. Also picked up David Cayley's "Ideas on the Nature of Science"- a compilation of the interviews in CBC's How to Think About Science podcasts Picked up a new book today as a late birthday present to myself - "Einstein's Clocks, Poincaré's Maps: Empires of Time" by Peter Gallison. @sgentiluomo I am about to curate the contents of a sandwich for lunch. @rtanglao Sure - if you can get down to Emily Carr any weekday that would be easy; otherwise we can try to set something up on a weekend. Just in case the whole TED conference thing wasn't enough, @TEDchris executes another amazing feat: actually getting me to visit CNN.com. Anyone know who is making content for the BT Tower's wraparound LED screen? (as show over at @WiredUK: http://is.gd/4Ijwt) If you don't watch it, Twitter, I'm going to demand my money back. Maybe Twitter should concentrate on having their service run without downtime before adding new features? @serial_consign Amen, Mr. Smith. And I mean that literally. The new issue @WiredUK will be in hands of subscribers on Monday- the biggest issue ever! Nick Bilton! Warren Ellis! Web Trend Map poster! @derekg I suppose I can't blame that mistake on Canadian spelling, can I? 'The point of Hype is to bring the fun back to Flash' - http://www.vimeo.com/7334376 7 Days of Source Day #6: NYTimes GraphMaker - http://is.gd/4HIXZ - a simple Processing sketch for analyzing word trends in the NYTimes. Finally getting code release #6 ready. Better late than never, right? Right? Just received two BUGVonHippel modules for @code_lab - http://bit.ly/36kgYA Ooooh... all of this NYTimes linked open data makes me very, very excited. I'm trembling.  (thanks, @derekg!) @rtanglao Not entirely sure - I'm just using the import com.buglabs.bug.module.gps.pub.IPositionProvider service... @rtanglao Yes - the cameras work but there are some issues - a 4 second lag to retrieve images. We are looking into using a USB camera... I haven't had a chance to even look at Twitter Lists, yet. Damn you, ever-expanging frontier of innovation! Damn you! I am now referring to H1N1 as 'the hiney' - as in 'i don't think Dave will be in today... He's down with the hiney'. Off to discuss the H1N1 genome with @jennifergardy - then perhaps some rock and roll with @Bend_Sinister at the Biltmore. If that last link made you feel big, this one will surely make you feel small: http://is.gd/4Gr4P (thanks, @toxi!) SCIENCE!!!!! http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/scale/ @flight404 Hmmm. I have them - I can put them up on a server for you if you'd like. This whole 'processing.org is down!' crisis is a good reminder of the utility of books. You know, the ones made of paper. http://is.gd/4EPLx @flight404 There are MP3 versions, too - do a search in iTunes. @flight404 CBC's How to Think About Science - http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/features/science/index.html @tararobertson Thanks - I'll track it down! It's a 'mark all as read' morning - sorry if I missed anything important, Twitterverse. @SteveMynett check the @foodists feed! Strange to be at a food/beer event I'm Vancouver and not recognize anyone - I feel like such a loner. Kinda disappointed there is no 'Best Twitter Visualization' in the OWA categories. Success with @buglabs! My simple app records a GPS path, automatically takes photos, and serves the whole thing as a .ZIP via webservice. Gorgeous UK traffic visualizations from ito world using data.gov.uk data - http://is.gd/4CZ1Z - very impressive. Just nominated http://www.flickr.com/photos/quasimondo/3518306770 for Tweet of the Year http://mashable.com/owa #openwebawards Just nominated brainpicker for Most Interesting Twitter User to Follow http://mashable.com/owa #openwebawards I seriously think you can justify the existence of Twitter with @brainpicker's feed alone. Are you in NYC? You should spend the AM with @zachlieberman on Friday: http://is.gd/4CEqT Experimenting with modular hardware - I posted a short overview of our adventures with @buglabs at @code_lab - http://is.gd/4BNIx Thanks to everyone who joined me for my Processing workshop this afternoon - I really enjoyed it. Fun times! Those of you heading to my workshop this morning - bring a sweater! It's a chilly morning in the church! Chocolate, violins, Canadian music, Los Angeles, food & obsessions at #IV09 - I had an excellent time. @rockitbaby Yes! Very cool. I get my students to play with hascanvas on their first day with Processing. Today I finally dug into Processing.js - http://processingjs.org/ - very easy to get started with. Looking forward to trying more things! @JoshuaPowell Yes, that and a liberal sprinkling of faerie dust. http://pretweeting.com is a speculative market where players buy and sell words on twitter. 'science' is currently trading at a lousy 25c. I'm looking forward to tomorrow's Processing for Web Programmers workshop - there are still a few spaces left - perfect for a rainy weekend! I hear there are a few tickets left for Interesting Vancouver. You should buy one of them. http://www.interestingvancouver.com/ @joekromer Yay! Good luck! Let me know if you have any questions. Also, I highly recommend Daniel Shiffman's Learning Processing book. How come I hadn't seen this until today? Data, data, data and more data at http://infochimps.org/ (thanks, @inspired12!) There are still a few spaces left for this weekend's 'Processing for Web Programmers' workshop: http://is.gd/4w8xq - 3D, AR, data & more! The Guardian posts sattelite tracking devices to test the effects of the Royal Mail Strike: http://is.gd/4w5es (via @NiemanLab) A good comparison between @buglabs and Arduino - http://bit.ly/olIpj Congratulations to @flight404 for waltzing his way through another year in style. @moizsyed Not sure yet - I guess it will be a surprise (maybe to me, too!) Great tangible & useful open data / open government project from NewspaperClub - The data.gov.uk Postcode paper: http://is.gd/4uzUL @vincentpants It is now! (it probably was before - don't have the list here) Processing level 2 workshop is still on for Saturday. A few spaces are still left! A reminder to Vancouver folks that I'll be speaking (for 10 minutes) at Interesting Vancouver on Friday: http://is.gd/4uoHf RT @golan: Tweeps! Got electronic junk in PGH? We need it! -- for the "Scrapyard Challenge" at ART && CODE. Contact me! Hacking as a way of knowing - a nice article on focused hack-days: http://bit.ly/NsMHi @wearepuny The shocking part is when you find out your pumpkin was responsible for an unsolved double murder in 1968. Forget the kids - how to extract the DNA from your halloween pumpkin: http://is.gd/4rKVP (via @alexismadrigal) GoodMorning! is getting a lot of retweetage today- reminder to new followers that the project is open-sourced: http://is.gd/4rvxM Great poster for a PSU student show - http://bit.ly/nmeaV  (via @brainpicker, again!) Now if I only had 150 tiled monitors: A life-sized blue whale, on your screen: http://is.gd/4rnfW (via @brainpicker) Great article on local uses of government data - 'What you can do with the right data' : http://is.gd/4r4Kx Thanks to @flowingdata for blogging GoodMorning - and asking readers to come up with some use for it - interesting to read the comments. 7 Days of Source Day #5: smart.rockets - http://is.gd/4q3l3 - fun with evolving spacecraft. Very elegant solution for visualizing RFID fields. I'm getting scooped on DataViz by @warrenellis! Perhaps I need more whiskey. Going to see those young upstart Penguins of Pittsburg play tonight. Will try to contain my banner jealousy. 7 Days of Source will be suspended for a few days - limited computer use due to a non-funcitoning cooling fan. Melted processor == bad. I am wearing my @pitchinteractiv t-shirt for my #flashpitt presentation - hoping it will give me the illusion of authority. @inspired12 Definitely! I'm here until Sunday. Good morning, Pittsburgh! Up way too early to give a 10 minute sneak-peak of an un-lanuched project at the #flashpitt lightening session. Very happy to be featured on the Canadian Design Resource: http://is.gd/4mnSO - I'm in very good company. 7 Days of Source Day #4 - BC Budget Visualization Tool: http://is.gd/4lRZS @macfarbt I wasn't talking about you - I hadn't even noticed! Still, thanks! It's not immediately clear what is Super about the Super Shuttle. Finally arrived in Pittsburgh. Sitting in YVR, digging through the motherlode of public data - so many many many possibilities... Even after 34 years of people putting an 'e' at the end of Thorp, it still bugs me. Going to put together Source release #4 on the plane ride today - should go up at the end of the day. The noise has now stopped but I have a sneaking suspicion that my fan has, too. My computer sounds like a lawnmower thismorning - not a good sign. Let's hope it holds together until #flashpitt Somehow I always arrive at conferences late - I get into Pittsburgh at midnight tomorrow for #flashpitt At the Alibi after an exceedingly long day. Notice: Bleeding Through and Toxic Holocaust will not be playing tonight. #randomsigns @serial_consign Pale Fire! Brilliant. I read it for the first time last year and I think I’m already set for a re-read. 7 Days of Source Day #3: tree.growth - http://is.gd/4jHOG - grow some algorithmic trees! Finally getting my third source release ready - should be available for download within the hour. Stay tuned. RT @golan: Registration is open for MOBILE ART && CODE! http://artandcode.ning.com. Lots of space in Sunday workshops. Day #3 of source is delayed. Expect it to appear tomorrow. Day #3 source will be delayed a bit - hopefully will get to it this evening. @zefrank I really enjoyed The Lazarus Project, by Aleksander Hemon - http://bit.ly/4qGyNT @tararobertson Processing can be used for electronics, for print work, for installations, for video, for data visualization- almost anything @tararobertson http://www.processing.org http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language) @flashfreaker Good idea - no time to set it up today, though! Madness... Those who would like to attend the Processing workshop this afternoon should RSVP to us - info@ecucodelab.org (ECU students & faculty only!) I'm teaching a FREE Processing workshop this afternoon for Emily Carr students & faculty, part of the @code_lab residency http://is.gd/4hMTp Re-reading Ex Machina - this might be the perfect comic series - http://bit.ly/uxVf8 YouTube for biology: Learn to implant engineered tissue into a rat's heart, from the comfort of home! http://www.jove.com/ (via @timoreilly) A bit of algorithmic spiritualist eye-candy to brighten the afternoon: Mandalas, by Andres Tellez - http://is.gd/4fZAm Dusting off some old source code for tomorrow's release. Opening old code is like finding a time capsule, from yourself. @earlatron Thanks! The British Open Data initiative looks very promising. The Guardian has been prevented, for the first time in living memory, from reporting Parliament: http://is.gd/4fX7y http://is.gd/4fX7M Elevation: @mezzoblue has released a free route visualizer that renders data in 3D space (built with Processing!) http://is.gd/4fSr6. Nice! I think there are still some tickets left for @FlashPitt - a one day event in Pittsburgh on Friday. I'm speaking last - come and say hi! Are you an artist, an art student, or an art appreciator in BC? You should be following @stopbcartscuts. Shame on the Telegraph for giving this racist dimwit valuable blog space: http://is.gd/4fORw. Rachel Marsden redefines 'waste of space'. 7 Days of Source Day #2: NYTimes 365/360 - http://bit.ly/dBoXG Let's see if I can get through this week of code releases without inadvertently sharing important passwords with the general public. 7 days of Source Day #1: GoodMorning! http://bit.ly/sPlyJ Getting my first source release cleaned up - should be ready to go in about an hour. Fascinating medical detective story about concussions & the NFL: http://bit.ly/QxdPV A Thanksgiving gift for everyone: I'll be releasing source code for 7 of my projects over the next 7 days:  http://is.gd/4cBox Got my Google Wave invite. Too late to get the username(s) that I wanted, so settled for 'thorpjer'. Now to figure out what this thing does. @ivncrz Sure - come by! I will be here until 3, at least. Thanks to Ken Perlin for his engaging talk at SIAT today. Ken demoed a low-cost multitouch device he is developing which shows real promise. Very interesting data art installation by Ryoji Ikeda at the Surrey Art Gallery - Vancouver folks should make the trip to see it. This is my kind of science - metagenomic DNA analysis of splattered windshield bugs: http://is.gd/48tMm (via @tomburket) Headed out to Surrey to see Ken Perlin talk about multi-touch input devices. I wonder if he brought his Oscar? Did you know Google uses search results as indicators of flu activity? http://www.google.org/flutrends/ (thanks, @juliandolce!) @mrstephenbeck Yes - now let's hope the NYTimes can actually make some money, and set an example. RT @nickbilton: The NYTimes is hiring developers, developers, developers: http://www.nytimes.com/features/openings/index.html At the Alibi Room for the first time in a month. I like to think it missed me. However, Eaves' argument falls apart when you consider the UK's excellent new open data initiative. (http://is.gd/45zLX) I've been asking myself why Canada has no open government initiaitve. David Eaves has a theory: http://is.gd/45zDf (via @timoreilly) Thanks to @NiemanLab for pointing me to this panel discussion between Clay Shirky and Andrew Keen - http://is.gd/45zhW @mezzoblue After what you said about Twitter's mother the other day, I'm not entirely surprised. Wow - this is really nice use of 3D in Flash - very engaging. http://wonder-wall.com/#project/en @quidcode @rtanglao Yes - the system could definitely benefit from a set of processing-like libraries that would make the whole ordeal easier. Wow, indeed - modified piano can speak! Great video, with lots of process insights- http://is.gd/43Yaa (via @golan @flight404 @bwycz) I like these Bridge Hypothesis compositions- from an architectural projection by @mariuswatz: http://is.gd/43Urv - 'no regard for gravity!' I'm happy to hear that @flight404 is finally going to open the sandwich emporium of his dreams. Save a corned beef on rye for me! @cbrumelle Elliot brood tomorrow? How'd I miss that? Do you know if it's sold out? Night four of @citrshindig at the Railway Club. Being judgemental, and getting paid in beer. FreshMedia is hosting a one-day forum in Vancouver on Oct. 24th to 're-imagine journalism and media in Canada' - http://is.gd/41eXR @ben_fry I'll admit, #jetlnsetwotars has a certain ring to it. @ben_fry But it should, shouldn't it? We just need some kind of train-specific lingo. 'Just De-railed' might work for Amtrak... Another day working w/ @buglabs gear- thanks to the BUGpeople who have been very patient and helpful with my problems. Making some progress. Apparently the slide deck for my presentation 'Emergence' at @tocame_munich last year is 'Hot on Twitter'. http://is.gd/40DRq - who knew? Heading to Falconetti's for the home opener - just like old times. I've spent almost all of today working with shell commands. Going. Cra.z.y. @flaccus Question comes from a friend - I will check back with him and see if I can dig up some details. Does anyone remember a Flash 4 era web project about wrestling? In B&W? It won a pile of awards back in the day... Wow - Ken Perlin will be speaking at SFU Surrey on Friday - http://www.sfu.ca/siatclass/IAT805/HOME.html @benhammersley Does it blow, or suck? Or both? Flash on the iPhone, but not in the browser - http://bit.ly/sYndK Experiences w/ @buglabs gear have been fairly frustrating. So far have been unable to get simple things to work. Mind you, I am incompetent. NYTimes readers can now create custom RSS feeds (with Article Search and TimesTags APIs under the hood): http://is.gd/3YMQV via @marciw_nyc The workshop and lecture schedule for MOBILE ART && CODE is announced: http://is.gd/3YJQG (via @golan) @jennifergardy Yes, I did! The existence of Twitter can be justified by @errolmorris' feed alone. The 2009 Sterling Prize Lecture: Michael Worobey on the search for the origins of HIV, Tuesday Oct 13 at Wosk Centre: http://is.gd/3VoOS In my other life, I'm a baker: http://bit.ly/Do3ik If @benhammersley's experience is any indication, fizzy Vodka is going to be a big hit on the college scene. For news on the BC Liberals' bizarre and ill-fated attack on Arts & Culture, follow @stopbcartscuts Clay Shirky takes a pair of scissors to his local paper to analyze the balance of news - http://is.gd/3UNqW In any case, I'm still disappointed after finding out that the 'bar' in 'barcamp' doesn't serve drinks. Or have a bartender. Or peanuts. Yet another event happening in Vancouver today that I somehow forgot about. I need an assistant. Or, I guess, functioning memory. @benhammersley If there ever was a time for caviar-flavoured crisps, this is certainly it. Good overview of Moritz Stefaner's Elastic Times application & NYTimes Article Search - http://is.gd/3THYi  (via @derekg) @vincentpants The Processing for Web Programmers workshop that was supposed to run tomorrow is now on the 24th. Playing with my new @buglabs gear. Seems to be a steep learning curve - let's see if I can get something working by the end of the weekend. Review of the UK's open data initiative - http://bit.ly/5gEwE (via @agladders @tom_watson) If someone were to send me a Google Wave invite, I wouldn't complain. Just saying.

Alternately, I could always shave my beard and look 21 again. @tararobertson I am not going to nominate myself! Just found out about the TEDx Vancouver Event on November 21st - http://tedxvancouver.com/ Last day to nominate speakers is today. Fascinating - generating prime numbers with Conway's Game of Life - http://is.gd/3QBp3 (via @Quasimondo) @kalisurfer No - next talk is at Flashpitt. @kalisurfer There is a near endless supply of data being released online every day - it's just a matter of digging a bit to find it! Thanks to @flinklabs for pointing me to this excellent visualization of Channel shipping traffic: http://is.gd/3PP1t Looking at the amazing amount of data available to track marine shipping traffic, in real time. Some fascinating information available. @markbusse @bmann If it's protected - it must be good! @mtchl Good point. I guess I didn't get much farther into the mini-site than the pretty pictures...! @mtchl There are definitely some 'old favourites' in there - but I think that is probably necessary? I will try to make it out to next week's Vancouver Open Data Hackathon - http://is.gd/58dW2 What an astoundingly excellent body of work presented in the V&A's Decode exhibition- congratulations to all involved: http://is.gd/58chU I am such a sucker for all things geometric - currently I'm mesmerized by Jen Stark's paper cut sculptures:  http://is.gd/589Ug RT @REAS Today is the last day to order Processing t-shirts for holiday delivery. http://processing.org/shop/ RT @nickbilton: Google News: 7,218 articles about Tiger Woods fender-bender. Compared with 819 about four cops shot to death in Seattle. Just got great news about a very exciting project I'll be working on in the new year with @cbrumelle - data, music & innovation - yipee! @sebleedelisle Like I said - general awesomeness! Nice- @filipecalegario has built a novel Twitter viz tool called M.O.N.E.R.A, which places tweets inside of an ecosystem: http://is.gd/574mw Huge congratulations to @sebleedelisle for winning a big, shiny BAFTA award which I can only assume is for general awesomeness! These FedEx tracking devices could have some interesting alternate applications: http://is.gd/567HG (via @brainpicker ) @JeffClark adds to the list of #911txts visualizations w/ video of phrase frequency over time: http://neoformix.com/2009/Sep11PagerData.html This article about Vancouver's Girls Rock Camp is amazing. TO-XIC VO-MIT! http://is.gd/54SsH (via @tararobertson) Just starting a new project that is daunting in its complexity - I think it will take me a few hours to even know where to start. If you're coming to Canada, it's best to tell the border guard your talk is titled "How I Learned to Love The Olympics!"- http://is.gd/54M7u Looks like quite a few people are looking into the #911txts: @pitchinteractiv- http://is.gd/54jew @flight404 - http://is.gd/54jeF The NYTimes does it again with this clever geo-viz of Thanksgiving recipe searches: http://is.gd/54azz(via @ben_fry) At the alibi, catching up with an old friend who has been at sea. Yaaar. @lecourrier I don't really know. I wish I had time to dig into the dataset in more detail. I might sneak an hour or two this weekend. @flight404 That would be excellent - and quite creepy, I think... CBS Analysis of the #911txts release is detailed - perhaps there was a leak of the leaks? http://is.gd/53sQE I wish I had the day off tomorrow to do something interesting with the #911txts release -  but I don't. So I can't. Incredibly interesting data set being released over the next 2 days by WIkiLeaks - 500,000 9/11 intercepts: http://911.wikileaks.org/ If this isn't a feel-good news story, I don't know what is.

Imagine - Essential Javascript, by José Saramago. Vancouver folks - it's the last day of the East Side Culture Crawl (http://is.gd/51cl4) - and it's not raining. Now is the time! Nice links from @golan and @adehaas in response to Sarah Gee's geometric art - http://julieevans.blogspot.com http://johnpowers.us George LeGrady has a Processing window open on his desktop. I am in love with these geometric construction paper works by Sarah Gee - beautiful: http://www.sarahgee.ca/gallery/ Very much looking forward to hearing George LeGrady talk about Agency & Algorithms, and hearing Open Ended Group talk about field... #if09 JoAnn Kuchera-Morin's talk today at #if09 was phenomanally inspiring. I have about 1000 questions for her but she is off to Australia. I have a 3-D glasses headache. It all brings me back to Expo 86 - where's Expo Ernie? And UFO H2O? And the Irish Rovers? Heading back to ECU for Interactive Futures! After that, you can come to Code on Tap at the Alibi! http://rilli.com/events/4109 JoAnn Kuchera-Morin, of Allosphere fame, will also be speaking tonight, part of Emily Carr's free speaker series: http://is.gd/4Yh11 Very clever scroll-bar clock - http://toki-woki.net/p/scroll-clock/ (via @tocame_munich and @marcthiele and @alan-ross) @benhammersley Oh come on - it would be much more exciting to be on last with the free bar... @kk Actually it looks like they are now listed on that (frequently changing) page.

Very corporate focus - No scientists. No artists. No musicians. I'm surprised. @TEDxVan has announced their speaker line-up for Saturday: http://tedxvancouver.com/speakers2009/ Thanks to @infosthetics for featuring my Tokyo | Cairo blog post: http://is.gd/4Xt31 - release of the tool should be this weekend. Maybe. @mezzoblue Yes, I am asking you instead of spending 30 seconds on Google. It's the social aspect that counts. Wow - the nook looks great.

Eco in short form is both tantalizing and frustrating - I'd love to read 10,000 words from him on Google... @jny2 I think he's spot on about teaching the art of how to be discriminating. However I think his opinion on Google is a generalization. "If you interact with things in your life, everything is constantly changing. And if nothing changes, you're an idiot." - Umberto Eco Umberto Eco also has something to say about Google & authority - near the end of this interview on the subject of lists: http://is.gd/4VOSI With some thoughts about algorithmic authority, @cshirky gets us thinking to start the week: http://is.gd/4VMKU Huge congratulations to the new Mr. @theadnostic and Mrs. @mezzoblue.

Exciting day at @code.lab - building databases and designing robotic owls (well, at least part of that is exciting...) Anyone have advice on converting a MS SQL Server backup file to MySQL tables?

I've created a page with links to all of my source releases & tutorials - more to come! http://bit.ly/4r8ddW Bend Sinister, everyone's favourite Vancouver indie-prog masters are giving away some free MP3s on their site: http://bendsinisterband.com If you are involved in the business side of IT (management, governance, strategy) you should follow @infoparadox (a free plug for my Dad...) Toronto people - @JoshuaDavis will be giving a workshop on his (+ @waxpraxis) AS3 creative framework HYPE this weekend: http://is.gd/4RaLC Not so cute and fuzzy: let's see Disney try to anthropomorphize this - http://bit.ly/2SSSjO (via @flight404) National Text Comparison Day continues - an analog device for optical collation: http://www.gaffta.org/studio/facility/ (via @wattenberg) Add GAAFTA to the list of 'reasons I'd like to live in San Francisco' http://www.gaffta.org/ - social consciousness through digital culture. Chris Thorpe (@jaggeree) uses technology to turn his walking holiday in Australia into a fundraiser. Nice one, Chris! : http://is.gd/4R2bm Here's a link to @JeffClark's Document Contrast Diagrams, which do what I was trying to do, only much better and in 2008 http://is.gd/4R22w Fantastic! @JeffClark responds to my Two Sides of the Same Story Post- analyzing the same stories w/ a tool he has built: http://is.gd/4R1US Thanks to @infosthetics for pointing me to the excellent data art work of Willem Besselink: http://is.gd/4R1DS @serial_consign Thanks! It's a quick project but I think it turned out well - it certainly was useful for me in thinking about the 2 pieces. Thanks to @serial_consign for pointing me to this short but convincing call for quantitative history - http://is.gd/4QCDk New blog post: Two Sides of the Same Story - http://is.gd/4QBbP - comparing two articles from GQ & The New Yorker on head injury and the NFL Here are a few more screenshots from the Laskas/Gladwell piece I have been working on this weekend: http://is.gd/4QmHp - blog post coming... I think about 60% of the Twitter lists that I'm on are titled with the word 'nerd' or 'geek'. @cloudforest The tool is built with Processing (http://www.processing.org) I'm starting to get somewhere with my GQ / New Yorker visualizations - http://www.flickr.com/photos/blprnt/4084645482/ Simple and brilliant concept for this NYTimes interactive piece on the Berlin wall - http://is.gd/4PMWH (via @cbrumelle) Fascinating article about Raymond Carver and his symbiotic/parasitic relations w/ editor Gordon Lish: http://is.gd/4PM2d (via @trentgilliss) @sebleedelisle is the Patron Saint of Parking Fines http://bit.ly/4pCxze @trentgilliss I agree. It's interesting looking at the word use how much the articles vary, despite being about the same thing. Working on an interesting little viz project comparing articles on the same subject from GQ & The New Yorker. I am watching the @zefrank tarmac cheeseburger situation with great interest. Where is the FOX news coverage?? Fantastic article on teaching kids to program - this is the new literacy: http://is.gd/4P8dO (via @REAS) I think I may be having e-mail issues - so if you've tried to get in touch over the last little while with no response, please try a DM. New blog post - Data in Contemporary Art: Brian Jungen - http://bit.ly/17BVX1 @sgentiluomo Remember the squeaky wheel! Or was that the early bird? I can never remember. @WiredUK illustrators do a great job of revamping vintage infographics: http://is.gd/4OXnW Perhaps they should have built the Large Hadron Collider somewhere where there were fewer underground tunnel birds? 7 Days of Source Day #7 - Variance: Better Design Through Genetics? http://bit.ly/46b5fK Documenting the Variance project source for release. Obviously I wasn't feeling very comment-y in January of 2007. Brodie Kitchen has posted an interesting experiment on the @code_lab blog surrounding expectation & obligation: http://is.gd/4OaEK @rgm Ah, Shoppers Drug Mart. That place is pretty good, I went to law school there. Well, I'll be - my BUG is recording video from a webcam. Thanks mostly to the very patient help of @johnconnolly  from @buglabs. @serial_consign I'll admit that has a certain ring to it. @serial_consign I have finally made some small progress in my epic BUG / Linux / Kernel / Webcam adventures (catchy title, eh?) - surprising even me. Apparently Nick Cage is broke. Perhaps he should consider a new career in acting? Again I'm impressed by the helpfulness of @webfaction support. After years of shit w/ 1and1 I'm shocked when people actually help. Thanks for the suggestions, @flashfreaker, @pimento_loaf, @rydesign, @johnathonV, @dss49 Thanks for all of the suggestions - it's a strange project management challenge (a public/tech art project & residency) Any suggestions for good free (or cheap) & easy project management software for OSX? Congratulations to @flight404, who has shows coming up in London (at the V&A), Seattle, and SF in the coming months: http://is.gd/4M7yD What do you think about Jonathan Harris's vignettes about 'World Building in a Crazy World'? http://is.gd/4LJU1 @icathing This attitude towards fiction, which I run into more than I would ever expect, is surprising at best and terrifying at worst... Nice preliminary work by @brendam repurposing some of my NYTimes API code for use in an open gov application - http://is.gd/4LmsU @djweir Personally I'd rather he felt the flame's searing, painful heat. Today looks to be another day of wrestling with Linux, compiling kernels, and generally acting like a blind monkey with no tail. Good times. Congrats to @flowingdata @ben_fry & @wattenberg for being featured in CNN's Data Viz article! Nice! http://is.gd/4Ldqu The @tangibleint Graffiti Wall is looking amazing - the stencil interface is really great: http://vimeo.com/7260240 In case you wondered what a visualization of the phrase 'Too much time on your hands' might look like: http://xkcd.com/657/ via @SarahDobbs Trying to do something that is so far above my head it appears as the tiniest speck. RT @arikan: analyze entire human genotype in ~3 hours with Hadoop + 40x EC2 servers (320 cores) + $100 http://is.gd/4KtQk (via @igrigorik) A more serious partner for my News Alarm: http://bit.ly/14UJ8o Happy new year, in advance - the best part of this year was meeting so many amazing people. Far too many to list in a meagre 150 characters. The mail man was good to me today - my #processing t-shirts arrived, as well as a hoodie from @pitchinteractiv. Thanks, Wes! @tangibleint It's a secret - wrapped under many layers of NDA... Great to hear that @flight404 will be attempting to be a bit more verbose this year - http://www.flight404.com/blog/. Incredible that the 1000 square-metre park I designed this year with @tangibleint isn't the largest thing I've worked on in 2009. @harrisj Nice stats - vicious design. It makes my eyes hurt. (http://albertoconti.posterous.com/true-odds-of-airborne-terror) Nice to see @ben_fry's Origin of Species piece at the top of this list of 5 best viz projects of 2009: http://is.gd/5FP9M. Well deserved. Getting back to ActionScript for the first time in a while. It feels like I never left. @mezzoblue I read Anathem last Christmas - made for excellent beach reading. Need to get a 16"x16" photo scanned in Vancouver. Where should I go? Meeting with @serial_consign later- always interesting to meet 'web people' in person. Must refrain from restricting sentences to 150 chars. @flight404 working on an installation design. In my head, I know how it should work but the math turns out to be quite complicated. Some artifacts from my struggles with circle packing today: http://is.gd/5CMVV An afternoon spent solving a simple geometry problem has reminded me again that my math skills are still at grade-school level. Reading about Apollonian gaskets - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket A belated holiday greeting to all - I hope everyone enjoyed a little bit of time off. Now, get back to work. Slackers. Great article by @david_a_eaves about the dissolving border between citizens and journalists: http://is.gd/5AiTO @flight404 I'll get right on that. Should just be a matter of asking nicely, right? A fairly spectacular speaker lineup has been announced for TED2010: http://conferences.ted.com/TED2010/program/speakers.php Back in Vancouver. Leaving NYC after a short but very productive trip. Back to regularly sceduled programming. @wildting it's much better than it sounds. @wildting yes - a Cambodian Irish bar? Sounds terrible but the food has been phenomenal. My first try at a restaurant was closed for a xmas party - so I've happened on The Norry at Kampuchea. @chrisgrayson Thanks! I am looking through your recommendations - thanks! @jennifergardy Yes - I went there last time I was here! @chrisgrayson Not entirely sure. Somewhere with a good chef where I can get a good glass of wine. OK, New Yorkers- I need a restaurant suggestion. I'm staying (don't ask) right near Times Square. Any suggestions within a few subway stops? Heading over the ITP in a few minutes - sounds like there will be a strange confluence of friends there! Had my obligatory walk in the snow - now I'd like my room to ready so I can catch a nap before the ITP show this afternoon... I made it! Is there a drink called a white Manhattan? There should be. Made it into JFK - now stuck on the runway for a while. @sgentiluomo I sure hope so. If I every make it there... we'll see what the weather gods have to say. #snowpocalypse has made it's first attack on my trip to NYC - a 3 hour delay in Vancouver. I'll bet that number gets a bit bigger... @shiffman Yes! I will definitely ski over if I make it! @Quasimondo I'm a bit worried about my flight into NYC tomorrow! Beautiful - Generative identity for the COP15 Climate Change Conference, made w/ Processing: http://www.okdeluxe.co.uk/cop15/ (via @REAS) Watching the NYC weather forecast closely - my flight in tomorrow AM might be interesting. I'm jealous of my @foodists friends who are wine tasting while I'm working away. Curses! Looks like @sebleedelisle is gunning for a brit award next! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqnMG_Wnx2k @haigarmen Yes, I think I have 3. Despite what you may have heard, this cough and I are not 'together'. @Quasimondo Hey - no worries! Actually, these are two different packing problems. The one I asked you about is circles in a circle. @infosthetics has posted a nice review of the projects from Visualizar'09 - http://is.gd/5rpSV @UnitZeroOne Complex clusters of rectangles - like mad Tetris pieces. @johnconnolly from @buglabs has posted a thorough Wiki on building your own kernel for BUG: http://is.gd/5qJG0 This project that I'm working on is like the world's most complicated game of Tetris. I never was very good at that game. And here's an extremely in-depth analysis of the Met Office data: http://eagereyes.org/data/a-look-at-climate-data #climatedata We're starting to get a good collection of Climate Data visualizations in the #climatedata Flickr Pool: http://is.gd/5prjQ My apologies for the radio silence so far this week. To use the word 'busy' would be like describing the sun as 'warm'. @vincentpants That's pretty much what I'm doing. I was hoping there was a 'correct' way so that exported PDFs hold the tracking. Any #processing people know if it's possible to control type tracking? I'm rolling my own, but thought something may be buried/undocumented Strange to hear a 50 year-old radio host from Toronto talking about his dream to visit Manhattan. Get on a bus? @mgilbir has posted a very detailed analysis of the Met Office Data with plenty of visuals on his blog: http://is.gd/5m5mG #climatedata Just had my first blog comment by a climate skeptic/conspiracist - I'm surprised it took that long! http://is.gd/5kwDV Congratulations to Andrew Vande Moere, for 5 years of excellent content at @infosthetics. If you don't already follow - you should! Data Walks - @mtchl proposes an engaging way to make #climatedata tangible: http://is.gd/5kmb8 @mtchl Good question. This is one of the reasons why I've tried to sort the readings by latitude. Distribution: http://is.gd/5kiQA This is the kind of person it would be handy to have around when society collapses: http://is.gd/5k9rR (via @timoreilly) Have you made a #climatedata visualization? Please add it to the Flickr pool: http://www.flickr.com/groups/1270263@N24/pool/ Some #climatedata posts from today from @infosthetics  http://is.gd/5k42c and @sunlightnetwork http://is.gd/5k41P Another #climatedata data set, this time from the US Climate Reference Network: http://is.gd/5jVew More #climatedata visualization - this time from @eagereyes: http://eagereyes.org/data/interactively-explore-climate-data Some data exploration: 12 monthly images, visualizing all 1,670,354 released Met Office Climate records: http://is.gd/5jhMH #climatedata @flinklabs has posted a 3D globe visualization of the Met Office Climate Data: http://flinklabs.com/projects/climatedata/ #climatedata Michael Schieben has created a simple geographic visualization from the Met Office Data : http://vimeo.com/8102161 - beautiful! #climatedata Thanks to helpful folks at http://climatedata.blprnt.com I have a mySQL DB w/ 1,670,364  readings. Now that's a data set. #climatedata I hereby promise that I will be at the next Vancouver #opendata event. @lukec Unfortunately I can't make it down tonight - I wish I could but I can't. I found a considerably better theme for the Climate Data Forum - http://climatedata.blprnt.com/ - now we just need more people! #climatedata Alas, I probably won't make it to the Open Data Hackathon tonight in Vancouver - but maybe you will?  http://is.gd/5hfxb @serial_consign Yes, you're right! Hashtag! #climatedata Fast work! A script has been written to parse the Met Climate data into a MySQL DB! http://climatedata.blprnt.com/topic/here-is-the-data Join the discussion on Visualization & Climate Data - http://climatedata.blprnt.com/ New blog post on Data Activism & Climate Reality: http://is.gd/5gzWH and a makeshift forum to get the discussion started: http://is.gd/5gzWH Here it is: The Met Office releases a data set of average daily temperature values for 1,500 land stations - http://is.gd/5gxNE RT @mslima: Following the mobilization call (by @blprnt and me), here's a blog post on Visualization for Skeptics: http://is.gd/5gfNo Early in 2010, Microsoft will release a Processing-like tool called Vedea, specifically for data visualization: http://is.gd/5fwqF Better, thanks. Still sick but not as bad. Can we mobilize data visualizers vs. Climate change skeptics? This data could mark the way: http://is.gd/5evUQ  (via @mslima) @levite I've got a disease - I'm addicted to cheese! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpzaHapvSGk You have to admit that the sensationally wacky dreams make at least one positive thing about having a fever. After years with Processing I still try to use == to compare strings. RT @arikan: I do software art. What? You mean like internet painting? Yes I am an "internet painter." #artmiami #artbasel #nadamiami @MarkBusse Next thing you know, they'll be asking people to write software for free, too! The NewPoliticalInterfaces project came out of the Visualizar'09 workshop in Madrid, which seems to have been a success: http://is.gd/5cx6W A pair of very well-designed text analysis tools looking into activity on politics on the internet: http://newpoliticalinterfaces.org/ Very pretty & clever Digg visualization tool from Barbarian Group: http://labs.digg.com/365/ (via @tensafefrogs) For those of you hanging in suspense about that memory error (thrilling stuff, no?), it seems to be an OpenGL issue - no problems in P2D. Strange memory error in #processing when doing relatively simple pixel operations with PGraphics objects - http://is.gd/5crz1 - any ideas? At the Alibi Room for the 100th beer list celebrations. I'm going to be in NYC for a very very short trip in 2 weeks - I have one free day on Sunday the 20th. What to do? @sgentiluomo Awww... shucks! Reading 'The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age' - new models of pedagogy for the internet age: http://is.gd/59Ekl Looks like @nickbilton is getting a conversation started with his first post as lead writer for the NYTimes Bits blog - http://is.gd/59A6g The We Feel Fine book is released today - http://tinyurl.com/wffbook Design types take note - today is the last chance to get cheap(er) tickets for @designweek2010 in Vancouver. http://is.gd/7qTTh Sobering article by @NickKristof about the 5.4M people dead since 2007 in the eastern Congo - http://is.gd/7qDJ2 @JohnathonV The Alibi is installing TVs, too - downstairs and again only for special occasions. World Cup, for example. @juliandolce Clearly you didn't read the article about the official Apple Shock Troops. They're going door-to-door. @mrhartwick Nice! I have a libraryized version of that code which is waiting for me to get my act together to release. DM me if you want it. I'm surprised that anyone can actually call themselves a 'product evangelist' with a straight face. I’d like to say that I’ve conquered this Java madness. More accurately I’ve climbed to a low precipice, out of breath. Still, nice view. In case you missed this yesterday, an excellent beer-themed infographic from @mezzoblue: http://is.gd/7o4uW @UnitZeroOne Only the best for Mr. Klingemann! Looking for a Java 1.4 workaround to do what NetworkInterface.isUp() does. Any ideas? I use Flash/AS3 when it is the right tool for the job. In this case loading & animating a large number of masked images. This morning’s @code_lab adventures with creating a simple UI for our @buglabs devices is going remarkably smoothly. @UnitZeroOne Awesome! Buy the guy a drink for me, will you? I’ve been working in AS3 for the last two weeks. I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve typed ‘println’ when I’ve meant to type ‘trace’. Another busy day at @code_lab. Opening is on Thursday the 4th from 5-7pm, at Emily Carr on Granville Island. Come one, come all! RT @stopbcartscuts: "Games' cultural legacy will disappear if arts funding cuts continue" by Miro Cernetig. http://is.gd/7iUhJ I tell you, these are going to be the best Spring Olympics, EVER. New blog post: State of the Union(s) - http://blog.blprnt.com/blog/blprnt/state-of-the-unions @pitchinteractiv I *think* I'm in that book too - I guess we'll have to buy copies to find out... The cropped version of my the data piece from the NYTimes today is here: http://is.gd/7aOZD - the full version on Flickr: http://is.gd/7aP18 @MarkBusse It's amazing that after $600k, they still have a 'temporary site' - http://www.switchinteractive.com/ Headed to the Alibi for a brief respite. @iragreenberg It will be on the website, too - albeit in a drastically cropped form. Paper still wins in the resolution department! Buy a copy of the NYTimes tomorrow  - I made a small data art piece for the Opinion page, themed around the State of the Union address. Success! My @buglabs device is now recording .FLV video - which is then relayed wirelessly into our installation for @code_lab. Global contributions to Haiti earthquake aid total about $1.75B - 50 million more than Vancouver is spending on 2 weeks of Olympic games. Vancouver's second #opendata hackathon is tomorrow night at the city archives: http://is.gd/72LFk @glowry The delay is adjusted for by on-board computers. The clocks in the GPS satellites run fast by 38 millionths of a second per day due to relativistic effects. Theory in action! This has been the most painfully slow small project I've every worked on. 6 hours in and really don't have anything to show. Argh. Happy birthday to @quasimondo - probably the cleverest person I know. Old, yes - but still sharp! The Sunday Edition with Michael Enright on CBC is a staggering contrast of fantastic programming and excruciatingly bad music. This page from Edward Tufte's site holds a huge collection of Megan Jaegerman's infographics from the NYTimes: http://is.gd/6UWsO RT @cbrumelle: cool data visualization piece showing authoriship and collaboration of Beatles tunes: http://is.gd/6UVK5 Listening to a radio programme about the mapping ability of slime mold. Fascinating. http://is.gd/6TpUw @peterkirn I still use the PDE for 90% of my projects. Old habits die slow. Tonight's Peak Performance results were a good reminder that people with good taste DO NOT run the world. #bendsinister #robbed At the Commodore for the first time in a year - last show was Gaslight Anthem. Less general drunkeness tonight. So far. Arduino & AS3 fun, today. Hooking up some tables with rotation sensors to a projected Flash display. So far, so good. @jenstirrup's critique of my Haiti/Avatar visualization has merit:  http://is.gd/6OtML I should leave my MacBook charger at the studio more often. Certainly prevents late nights spent working. The Guardian Data Store has updated their Haiti Aid stats - I'll post updates to my Haiti/Avatar viz over the weekend. http://is.gd/6MjUr @elibancroft The Guardian Data set was actually updated today, putting Canada #1 in per-capita aid, at $3.89. http://is.gd/6MjUr @elibancroft My post was based on data available at the time. I will be updating. $1.67=32 minutes of Avatar. About 20% of the ticket price. Paging Guy Debord - All of this Olympic activity in Vancouver is providing a very accurate model of 'The Society of the Spectacle'. Looks like somebody else found the Avatar ticket price comparison useful in relation to Haiti aid: http://avatarforhaiti.com/ @mezzoblue It's okay - you're making up for me. I have only been there once in the new year. @casinclair - That's a long haul, but at least you're in Munich. Good people, there. Very excited about the new data project I'll be working on w/ @cbrumelle for CBCRadio3. Rock and data - together at last! Details coming... That last geek-reference was almost beat out by 'Donaldblakium'. A new (old?) green energy source, best when mixed with Mjolinirium - http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/ff_new_nukes/ Canadians feeling offended by my Haiti Aid / Avatar post would do well to read the 2009 Commitment to Development Index: http://is.gd/6GAOx #climatedata gets physical - @mtchl makes a form from 150 years of monthly average temperature data: http://is.gd/6DWEk @ mtchl @hapticdata @croby - figured it out. My project compiles in Java 1.6.... the app tries to run in 1.5. @croby http://blprnt.pastebin.com/m19d9faad Has anyone had any luck with the eclipseP5Exporter in OSX? It exports applications for me, but they can't be launched. My Haiti Aid in Avatar Minutes post seems to have raised the ire of both devout Canadian nationalists and hardcore Avatar fans. @canadawrite - the data I used is as up-to-date as possible. As new data comes in, I will update the results. @foodists Depends on how insane I am at that point - 4 days before the code.lab opening. @foodists Some of us foodists are already CAMRA members!

Here is the data set I used for the Haiti Aid in Avatar Time viz - http://is.gd/6wH5O. Modified from the original provided by @datastore $5.5M in Canadian earthquake aid is 16 cents per citizen - about 3 minutes of Avatar. How do other countries compare? :  http://is.gd/6uURc Per capita #haiti donations - $1.34 from the Danes, $1.30 from Guyanians, $1.03 from Norwegians - just $0.16 from Canadians.

Nice post from @toxi on wheels, splines and vectors: http://toxiclibs.org/2010/01/re-inventing-the-wheel/ So very bizarre that this photo is creeping up on 3,000 views - http://www.flickr.com/photos/blprnt/2822924992/ @MarkBusse Maybe it was a truffle heist? @mariuswatz I don't know - but I guarantee you it would take up at least 30 pages! Interesting post and follow-up discussion from @mathpunk on economics & mathematics- http://www.mathpunk.net/?p=74 Amazing things are bound to come out of @Ben_Fry and to his new business venture (catchy name, Ben!)- http://benfry.com/writing/archives/577 Thanks to @johhnmaeda for the RT on my Unlucky Haiti viz. There is a second version showing a bit more information here: http://is.gd/6opsR Did I tell you that I'm speaking at FITC Toronto 2010? Super Early Bird prices start today - http://bit.ly/3B5ujd This is a) extraordinarily geeky and b) absolutely something I would do - http://is.gd/6mtvu I finally got around (after almost a year) to packaging up my #processing NYTimes code into a library.

Strange to say, but - way to go, Air Canada! Seems they've donated use of a jet to Partners in Health (@pih_org). Care to match, @WestJet? RT @toxi: today is the day: come & see the new http://toxiclibs.org blog & follow @toxiclibs for updates @ReadyWater I agree there is probably a better way to show the data. I will post the source and hopefully others can improve... I just posted a quick data visualization comparing Haiti to other Caribbean nations: Unlucky Haiti - http://is.gd/6eyDi I just donated to Architecture for Humanity (@ArchforHumanity) to support reconstruction in Haiti. $$ goes to building back better. Note - if you'd like a BirdHerd invite, talk to @cbrumelle, not me! RT @cbrumelle: Launched BirdHerd recently (http://birdherd.com) Twitter made easy for groups, brands, etc. DM/hit me for an invite code. At the railway club. Disappointingly, the train isn't running. @tangibleint cool! Looks great... The Patron Saint of Processing Tutorials, @shiffman, has released another one, this time on http://processing.org/learning/pvector/ I love it when @derekg talks nerdy - new features for the NYTimes Article Search: http://is.gd/69vcD Fish chowder and excellent conversation for lunch w/ @awsamuel, who is doing very exciting things with social media at Emily Carr University @david_a_eaves We will collaborate!

I am thankful to have grown up in a pre-YouTube era. Listening to a radio piece on E.B. White - and remembering my run as Wilbur in my Jr. highschool's production of Charlotte's Web. What was the best thing built in #processing in 2009? My vote goes to @toxi's onedotzero generative identity: http://is.gd/5KnUK Terrifying photo set of dead albatross chicks on Midway Atoll - one of the most remote locations on the planet: http://is.gd/5K75t (via @kk) RT @REAS: A new #Processing book by Andrew Glassner is due out this Spring from O'Reilly, 800 pages! http://is.gd/5K3kY "Whites need to rethink their fantasies about race." Tx to @golan who pointed me to this article about sci-fi and race- http://is.gd/5JUyP. RT @nickbilton: Last few hours to enjoy this easter egg: Hit "I'm feeling lucky" on Google.com w/o typing into search box. /Via @google @_dreamPilot I haven't tried Ruby-Processing yet. I might try it when I get some time. Which, at this point, might be 2011. @paulcarvill Do you have the Galaxy Explorer? http://cache.gizmodo.com/assets/images/4/2009/07/IMG_3221.JPG @brsma Yes - definitely sensible. I'm not really complaining about #processing; more about my own thick skull! @mariuswatz That's a much better idea. Beware the terror that is a self-taught coder! #10YearsAgo I would have punched my future self in the face for working on New Year's Eve & New Year's Day. Reminded again of #processing's strange casting behaviour. 4 + (7/8) = 4, while 4 + ((float) 7/8) = 4.875. That was a wasted 30 minutes. Best title for an art piece ever?

This reminds me of a high school dance where the football team gets to pick the music. Nickelback sucked in 1997 when they were a bad, cheap, Pearl Jam knockoff. They suck even more, now, if that's possible. @flight404 I live across the street from an elementary school, and you should see those kids at recess: scale, rotate, scale, rotate. I miss hockey hair. Though I suppose it's possible that my dog might paint a maple leaf on his face if he had the chance. I will be watching the game with my dog, at home. I've had my fill of blustery nationalism over the last two weeks. For the last 13 days I've felt like I'm living in a David Foster Wallace novel.

Still no sign of Anderson. Huh. I thought we were playing the Russian team this afternoon. The Moose is in the box with Wayne! So far, no sign of Glen Anderson... #99 is 10 rows behind me. In a box, yes, but still... I am both excited and somewhat scared about going to the game this afternoon. Like a powder keg, dressed in red. Well, I'd say these quarter final tickets I have for tomorrow's 4:30 game are looking pretty good. @direct it's interesting if you are interested in making physical models of polyhedra. How I'm spending my afternoon away from the computer: http://yfrog.com/4actdvj Laptop is in the shop - so I am computerless for a couple of days. I feel empty. Canada is in danger of becoming to hockey what England is to football. I like how the Aquabus a)makes you wait in line and b)charges you more during the olympics. #jerks Celebrating my last day at @code_lab with a poutine at place de la francophonie Great digital knitting links! http://www.microrevolt.org/ http://www.microrevolt.org/ http://www.casualdata.com/newsknitter/ ~10% of visitors to CODE.lab have a noticeable visceral reaction to the word 'art'.

The best, unheralded house at #Vancouver2010 - particularly for food & beer lovers: @gastownhouse Just had a visit at @code_lab from the organizers of the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad.

Dave Bidini is right in front of me at the Constantines show. @icathing they are playing Tuesday as well. Tonight at Ontario House. Braving the lineups tonight to see The Constantines. We'll see how that goes. The city is really putting on a show for the tourists today. Might not have been a good pick for the Winter Olympics, but it sure is pretty.

Let me know when and where (I suggest, as I always do, the Alibi Room). This project I'm working on with @cbrumelle for CBCRadio3 is really, really fun. I am really enjoying working with processing.js! @icathing Certainly that's the strategy. Threaten 95% cuts. Back that up to 50% and hope to look like the good guys. BC Gov't has announced a 30M initiative to support arts in BC - that's one opening ceremonies budget, spread over all of BC, over 3 years. Anyone have experience recovering corrupted .MOV files? I suspect it is missing a closing resource fork or something...? AAAAAARRGGGHHH!! I accidentally hit 'save' in #Processing and ended up closing a rendering sketch 99.9% into a 10 hour MOV render.

I probably won't get a chance to play with Cinder for a few weeks. I'm sure you've all seen this by now - Cinder is a newly-released C++ framework for doing creative stuff: http://bit.ly/9GXUgF @flight404 Massachusetts. Where are you flying too/from? @hohmann Thanks! @ghostpressbed Thanks! Great meeting you. @grantlucas Cool! Thanks for the post! @geranyl Thank you for getting up early and coming to my session! Excellent - looks like I'll be in Cambridge in June to speak at IBM Research. May be a public event; I'll post details when I have them. Sitting in Kensington market in the sun. Finally getting a chance to catch up on e-mails. And maybe, a little *tiny* bit of hockey news. @grantlucas Yes - @pitchinteractiv I am in Toronto for a few more days, catching up with various friends. Just (thankfully) not living the hotel life. Getting ready to leave the #fitc hotel. Many thanks to all of the interesting people I had the chance to chat with this week. #fitc late nighters - we are at London Tap House at 250 Adelaide In bar RT @WiredUK: Our friends in the Conde Nast subs dept have just extended their bargain offer: WIRED mag delivered for just £2/issue http: ... Wes Grubbs (@pitchinteractiv) is speaking in 5 minutes at #fitc - don't miss it. Also streaming live on the Fitc site for those not in TO. Happy birthday to @markbusse, who, from the look of his Tweets from last night, probably isn't awake yet. Thanks to everyone who attended my (early!) morning #FITC talk. I'll be speaking at 12 in the same room on a very cool panel - join us! @moritz_stefaner I don't think I get the live stream - that goes to the speaker in the 'main' room. Up early, ready to speak in the coveted 9:20am spot at #FITC. Everyone is awake, right? Ben Kreukneit starts off with Massive Attack and De Stijl. That's what I call the right foot. #fitc Imaginary hotel supply conversation: "We like this ice machine, but do you have something noisier?" @flight404 stayed there during their 'soft launch' last year. Great room, but could see it falling short at full price. @flashfreaker actually, it's a diploma - from Pete's Upstairs School of Temporal Mechanics (& Pizza Factory) Is there really no one I know in the lobby/bar? Am I in the right hotel? @flashfreaker That depends on the delicate specifics of temporal mechanics. If someone could stop time for an hour or two so that I could have a nap, it would be appreciated. Heading to Toronto for FITC. Great at ACAD with a bunch of talented workshop attendees, and new #processing converts! At ACAD again, getting set for a full-day #processing workshop. @flashopen Nothing is new. This is an argument that has been rehashed again and again and again. Which is why I'm (mostly) staying out of it Heading off to ACAD to give a talk on art & data. I couldn't agree more: Flash as an attitude not a platform http://post.ly/cICU (via @brendandawes) @SteveMynett You were saying? My plan of leaving town to help the Canucks win isn't going well. @flight404 I'm in! @benry Thanks! I'll let you know how it goes... @flight404 I'm sorry. If we were ever booked at a conference together again (is there a rule I don't know about?) I'd give you a hug. @flight404 A country that doesn't use the metric system can hardly lecture about efficiency. How many roods in an acre, again? @NuvoHotels Just in time for me to leave on Saturday morning! @flight404 It's really amazing. For the main content and for the footnotes - in which I've found tonnes of excellent treasures. @talikrakowsky has posted a detailed blog about next week's @FITC panel that I am on with a host of incredible people. http://bit.ly/9RGZSl Now I am in Calgary, at the Hotel Arts.

Bunk. @YahooGeo's Placemaker gives me a pile of 999 errors even though I'm spacing my requests by 10 seconds, and not making that many. MetaCarta is (was) smart - it could parse 'Just landed in the big easy' to New Orleans. @ben_fry Sucess! HttpClient was the key. Actually, that's what I used to deal with the MetaCarta API - I should have thought of that first. @jaggeree Cool! Nice to see some really good sports data viz happening. @ben_fry I'm using Java's HttpURLConnection object. Getting a 400 error, though can't see why. Maybe I'll try HttpClient. Banging my head against a wall, trying to get Processing to play nicely with Yahoo Placemaker. NOT. WORKING. I spoke too soon. Google geocoding is great for addresses/locations. For unstructured content, it's no good. Trying Yahoo! Placemaker. Google's geocoding service is also very easy to use w/Processing. Will post a quick tutorial when I get the chance. Wow. Automatic geocoding on Google Spreadsheets is super cool. Re-writing my JustLanded engine, which used to use MetaCarta. Any tips on best practice for text w/ Processing.js? Loading an .SVG typeface right now, but it is a big performance hit. @SteveMynett you need to go to Rio Friendly meats on Hastings. Cheap, local lamb. @serial_consign Nice!

Nice to see @reas documenting some of the web's 'ancient history' (ie. 1996) - http://reas.com/blog/archives/118 Can we stop using the term 'game changing' like it's something amazing?

At this point it seems like it will be around May 13th. @ProcessingParis I will be in Europe in May/June - almost definitely will pass through Paris at some point in there. BOOO!

The #myrandomnumber request is for a post tomorrow about, among other things, teaching & data viz, number distributions, & google. In the meantime, keep 'em coming! (1 number per person, please!!) Wow. Great response so far from the #myrandomnumber request. Tomorrow I'll show you why I asked. Please note that I changed that last tweet to make sure people send me WHOLE numbers. Twitter friends - a favour, please? Tweet me a random whole # (off the top of your head) between 0 and 100, w/ #myrandomnumber (please RT) @mariuswatz I teach Classes in the second half of the first 3-hour lesson - easier to get it into heads then.

Bill Buxton once said to me "when you get good at something, learn something else". (via @brendandawes) I wish there was a hockey game on tonight. @IamVirtualNomad Don't know... sorry. Sounds like OpenFrameworks & Phonegap apps are in the clear with the new Apple policy changes. @wattenberg Congratulations! Looking forward to seeing what you guys build.

Now trying my luck with @airbnb to find somewhere reasonably central to stay. A bit of advance warning this time, Londoners - I'll be in town starting on Friday the 4th, until Wednesday the 9th. Just got back from the National Railway Museum in York. Fantastic museum - and free! I am in York, excited about a visit to the Train Museum tomorrow. I have always had a fascination with trains. This quote from a BP Engineer working on the big oil leak pretty much sums it up: "Nothing is good, nothing is good.” Big thanks to @blellum and family - I had a great time dodging cars! Later today I'm off to York & the National Rail Museum. Trains!! Thanks to @herbkim, @paulfabretti, @davidcoxon, @dshirlaw et al for the kind words. I really enjoyed #TDC10 - great people, great event! Reading about binary networks & criticality in Stuart Kauffman's excellent new book 'Reinventing the Sacred'. @flight404 I'd like to think that, in my last, dying moments, I'd find the strength text something much more prosaic. I'm going to watch a road rally race tomorrow with @blellum - let's hope I manage to stay out of the direct path of the cars! Problem solved. See you this afternoon, Edinburgh Unfortunately others seem to have had this 'go to Edinburgh' idea - can't find a hotel. Can't decide where to go for the next 5 days - so I'm heading to Edinburgh to think on it. Listening to a very interesting talk about Frontline SMS - simple tech for ad hoc mobile phone networks. @tonyodb a good idea - one that never really worked, though. Really enjoyed the band - Let's Buy Hapiness - at #TDC10. Yes, it's true. Good music at a conference! Heading for another pub lunch w/ @blellum at the Pitcher & Piano - #TDC10 @blellum Was Florence Nightingale the stage name of William Playfair? The 'semantic web' always feels a bit like Esparanto to me. Thanks to everyone who attended my talk at #TDC10. I had a great time - come say hi at the party. @dajbconf Hey - I look like a prat 90% of the time - so no worries!! I hope all of you #TDC10 delegates will be up bright and early for my morning session tomorrow. @blellum If it involves a pint or two - I am definitely interested. @darlingdash I don't know about clever, but I am certainly bearded. Am planning my own #TDC10 networking lunch. With a pint at a pub. All are welcome. @blellum yes - a pint, for sure. Let's meet up again at lunch time. In his #TDC10 talk, @documentally just called the CBC 'the Canadian BBC'. In case you're wondering, a computer-guessed gender breakdown from the attendee list at #TDC10 -- female:22.8% male:55.9% unknown:21.3% Out of 408 names, 87 were not guessed. Examples: Jamie, Rain, Carmen, Shaowen, Geir, Jackie, Alex, Robin. Using True Knowledge (http://www.trueknowledge.com/) to do gender guessing on a list of names. Seems to work quite well.

My first time up North - are there wolves there? Ok. So, I'm a sucker. But this is an amazing football commercial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idLG6jh23yE&feature=player_embedded @flight404 From what I heard you had NICE things to say about me. I was disappointed. Is it just me, or does Wayne Rooney look 20 years older than he did in last World Cup? I will always have a friend in beer. I'm at The Rake near borough market. Great place. @paulcarvill Alas... I will be in Newcastle tomorrow night. Thanks for the tim, though. Why am I friends with all of these busy, productive people in London? I need to find some slackers who aren't working on Monday nights. Curses. Would have loved to check out Avi Buffalo at @theoldbluelast tonight, but seems it's soundly sold out.

I get almost a full day in Amsterdam today, then off to London for two night before heading North. @mezzoblue the two of us could do some damage in the bar I'm in - 200+ beers... Drinking a hopped Belgian blonde called Lupulus at Gollem in A-dam. Brilliant. Back at the hotel after a great afternoon drinking beer under the windmill. What's next, Amsterdam? At Brouwerij 't IJ with @Alper enjoying beer in the sun. Come join us! I'm going to find lunch - then will make my way to Brouwerij 't IJ for some afternoon beer in the sun: http://www.brouwerijhetij.nl @David_Blendid Sure - I am just going to find some lunch then thought I would hit Brouwerij 't IJ later in the afternoon. Good Morning, Amsterdam! What a beautiful day you've delivered for me. Now, what should I do with it? For some reason, I'm craving pancakes. @aandnota doing an event at #MediaMatic It's a full house in Amsterdam for @shiffman http://yfrog.com/j9m2vj #MediaMatic in Amsterdam is an amazing space. And right now there's a bike ramp in it! Just getting ready got @shiffman to start... @ErikGelderblom I am speaking at at an event tonight hosted by #MediaMatic - http://www.mediamatic.net/page/148710/en Just arrived in Amsterdam. Hotel is right on a canal, but of course my room faces street-side! Have you seen the schedule for @flashbelt? http://bit.ly/aqyZPK I would come, just for the parties. And the bike ride. And the parties. I cannot adequately describe how much I love Paris in 140 characters. This city and I, we have a thing going on. Erno Rubik will be a plenary speaker at this summer's Bridges Math Art Conference in Pecs, Hungary http://bit.ly/bxtRdw (via @nselikoff) I just finished the moldiest food product I've ever consumed: http://www.flickr.com/photos/blprnt/4624230372/ @donebysimon I'm assuming this is some kind of hilarious and slightly dirty Dutch joke? Thanks to all of the helpful Dutch folk (and a Croat) who answered my Utrecht question. Sounds like Wolf Parade is in the cards on Saturday. Great info-comic: The Facts in the Case of Dr. Andrew Wakefield - http://tallguywrites.livejournal.com/148012.html How far is Utrecht from Amsterdam? Is it reasonable to Utrecht to see a show then get back to a hotel in Amsterdam? http://bit.ly/bd6Xnm I swear it wasn't me.

The French do not mess around. Interesting post by @mtchl on IBM's 'This is Data' campaign  http://bit.ly/cBYmJl Another unpublished @flashbelt bonus - all attendees get a free 12 mile run with Keith Peters (@bit101). It's true. (limit one per customer. management reserves right to decline service) Special @blprnt deal: If you go to @flashbelt, and say the word 'zirconium' to me, I'll buy you a beer. Are you going to be at @flashbelt? It's always my favourite conference of the year, and 2010 looks to be a winner: http://www.flashbelt.com/ @pitchinteractiv Yessir. Pity the English crushed the hopes of your Croatian team... :) I had the best whiskey sour of my life tonight, in a montparnasse bar. @blprnt Are you sure? Or is it just a conjecture that it's Poincaré? :o) (via @dullroar) I just discovered that I my room in Paris overlooks the grave of Henri Poincaré. @REAS The strange part is that some teachers seem to believe that those cohorts actually exist. The NYTimes is following Steven Strogatz' stellar series on mathematics w/ a series by Simon Critchley on philosophy: http://nyti.ms/bPAAFo Just mailed off my latest piece for @WiredUK. Will be excited to see it in print! Any non-US artists out there have experience with getting a visa for a residency? Seems like a nebulous area... Congratulations @zachlieberman! Super well-deserved: @eyewriter wins the golden nica at ars electronica - http://bit.ly/ckTUUs @MarkBusse I'm in Paris. Hard to want to be anywhere else, for a foodist. I am looking for a sublet for July & August in NYC - not terribly picky about neighbourhood but proximity to Columbia is a bonus. Help! I'm slightly jealous of the #foodists and their lamb disassembly. Anyone know how to tell OpenGL to scale strokes in #Processing? The plan of attack: : L'arsenale &gt; Centre Pompidou &gt; Palais de Paris. #NDMTW Tonight is La Nuit des Musées, so I may wander out and do some museum-ing. #NDMTW @jennifergardy I was at the Fête du Pain this morning. I was in baked good heaven. So far it's been 90% work though - next week = eating. @alibiroom Would love to see that list when you get it! These are productive days. Finishing up a @WiredUK piece, eating cheese. @bit101 Yeah, the decor is a bit 'french farmhouse' for my taste. Luckily, that annoyance seems to go away with cheese. The @blprnt Paris office (albeit for only a week): http://www.flickr.com/photos/blprnt/4606291430/in/set-72157623933795415/ Interesting article: "Locational Privacy, and How to Avoid Losing it Forever" - http://www.eff.org/wp/locational-privacy Argh. Sick in Paris. I suppose it was inevitable with all of this traveling. Let's hope I can defeat it quickly. Adobe, Apple, and Processing, together on stage! http://bit.ly/bDzwCM (thanks, @FOTB) When I find myself with a bit of un-taken quiet time, I'm going to dig into Cinder - via the tutorial that @flight404 has put together. @jennifergardy Will do. It's close by - I'm in the 14th. Somehow, staying next to the cemetery in Paris is charming, while in other cities it might be just creepy. @juliandolce I like the Hawks, but I'm a sucker for the underdog. @ProcessingParis Definitely will do. @artfulmanager Thanks! Like most of the rest of Canada, I am now officially a Habs fan. At least for the next few weeks. Found a (hopefully) great apartment via @airbnb in which to live & work (& cook) in Paris for the next week. Let's hope it's as advertised. @BCbrews Brussels. Sure, I might be missing @VCBW and all the beery fun, but I am staying two blocks away from de Bier Tempel: http://www.biertempel.be/ RT @opendataottawa: DONE! Ottawa is now an Open Data city. Here’s your new site: http://ottawa.ca/online_services/opendata (via @daeaves) One night in Brussels - seems like a beautiful city. I just shocked myself by having a full conversation with the taxi driver in Brussels in French. It turns out finding a last minute room in Paris is difficult. Amazing, poetic, and important: Fiona Bowie's Surface: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/the-art-of-absence/article1565027/ Amsterdam folks can RSVP for my May 21st #Processing Salon with @shiffman - http://www.mediamatic.net/page/148710/en (thx, @alper!) @UnitZeroOne @quasimondo - none of us are surprised that you were the first two to reply...! Having an excellently geeky math conversation with @bit101 and @waxpraxis. @tverbeiren No - I am heading out of here tomorrow, to parts unknown... @sermad Not entirely sure at this point. Definitely btw the 21st and the 9th. London probably at the end of the trip. My favourite data-informed interactive news piece of the year so far? Still this one, by Amanda Cox: http://nyti.ms/cJAAna Thanks to everyone who attended my talk at #2M10 - didn't have time for questions, so come and find me if you want to chat!! @delabassee Thanks! Find me and say hi before you leave... The NYTimes has built a simple & beautiful Flash interface for their Moment in Time project: http://nyti.ms/aQnovE I am just realizing that I have no plans whatsoever for the next 9 days. The Belgians do not mess around when it comes to conference centers. You could park a plane in the room I'm going to be speaking in. Well, I guess I'll wander aimlessly and find somewhere to eat. If anyone in Kortjik wants to join - DM me. #2M10 Hey @newmovieclip @waxpraxis @bit101 @ktukker - what's the dinner plan tonight? @tverbeiren I'm in Belgium right now, speaking tomorrow in Kortrijk: http://www.multi-mania.be/2010/ And yes, I have been enjoying the beer! There are hours of fun to be had with WebSeer: http://hint.fm/seer/ My favourite: 'squirrels are... the devil's oven mitts' @serial_consign There's no doubt that it's impressive, live. Worth seeing. I do think it changes- what I saw in Surrey was a new version... @shiffman Yes! I am looking forward to it already... :) @serial_consign In 140 chars? The work is really visually beautiful & precise. Concept seems obscured by presentation - if it exists at all? My European tour continues! I will be in Amsterdam on May 21st for a #processing salon with @shiffman at MEDIAMATIC. Details when I get 'em. @UnitZeroOne Nice work, Ralph. Good luck! @delabassee Yes - I am speaking at Multi-Mania tomorrow: http://www.multi-mania.be/2010/ Woke up late in Kortrijk. Birds still tweeting, though, which means it's not *that* late. I completed the holy trinity of beer today - a Budvar in Czech, a stout in the UK, and a Leffe in Belgium. I wonder how the #canucks are going to deal with their sub-prime Luongo crisis. I'd be remiss not to thank @misssophies in Prague for their excellent service, great rooms, and amazing shower! Upscale hostel, indeed. @devdev_be SN2102 - let's pray to the Icelandic gods of lava and ash. @scottjanousek Yes - I have visited my share of 'World of Whiskey' locations. Who is going to be at Multi Mania on Tuesday? Europe's biggest FREE multi-media event: http://www.multi-mania.be/2010/ Somehow I also missed seeing Just Landed added to the Processing.org exhibition: http://bit.ly/aju6ei - I am thrilled!! Sometime over the last few days, while I wasn't looking, my 3000th follower joined the crowd. The pressure is ON. I'm continuing my tour of LHR terminals with 4 hours in Terminal 1. Better bars. Video gambling terminals. 70s decor. @devdev_be Excellent. I'll be on the look-out. My flight out of Prague is delayed - is #ashpocolypse upon us again? Last night in Prague. Will be sorry to leave. Hearing about problems maintaining Jenny Holzer's 'UNEX Sign no.2' Unreadable diskettes, broken hardware. Listening to Alain Depocas from the Langois Foundation talking about challenges with archival of tech-based artwork. If you are looking for a great conference to attend this summer, to meet amazing people and learn 1 million things - @flashbelt. This talk on visualizing archives is the @moritz_stefaner show! Listening to Gabriele Blome talk about visualization of archives at Transistor 2010. I just shattered the front screen of my iPhone, with a very short and seemingly non-threatening fall to the floor. Shit. I am teaching a #processing workshop today at FAMU in Prague, as part of Transistor 2010. @mtchl Thanks! Oh, and thanks for all of the people doing their best to allay my @flashbelt anxiety. I think I can sleep now. Londoners - looks like I will be in town from May 19th to 24th. Shall we get up to some trouble? I'll admit it - I'm a little nervous about being the closer for this year's @FlashBelt. With a brand new presentation, to boot. @mtchl - I'm putting together some links on Processing & archives. I'm using some of your work, of course - any suggestions come to mind? Got back to my hotel 10 minutes before the thunderstorm hit. It's a grey, cold, rainy day in Prague. Think I might play the lame tourist and stay in to get some work done.

True. I've been in Prague for two days and already my clothes all smell like smoke. Reminds me of old, less healthy times. @benhammersley I stayed in the LHR Yotel last year after a mis-booking. I was great. I felt like I was staying in the future. Only smaller. I'm at FAMU in Prague, getting ready to give a short artist talk. Bad news: up at 5am, due to jetlag. Good news: Streaming the Canucks game. Eating Mexican food in Prague. Makes sense to me. Sitting in Heathrow Terminal 4. Trying to pretend it's daytime. REMINDER: Take a photo for #Moment in Time global photo shoot a 11a.m. E.T. (15:00 U.T.C.) Details here: http://nyti.ms/cyEHzs (v @nytimes) Well, I'll be damned. @flight404 Hmmm. Tempting. But I think I'll go to Prague and drink beer instead. Sorry. @flight404 I wish! No, the boring old white one, with the old buildings and stuff. Last day in Toronto. Tomorrow, I'm off to the Continent. @scottjanousek Sorry Scott! You can, now... ! @bit101 I actually had more ribs in Ottawa on Saturday. The redbones ones were better. This is my second time in Montreal in two weeks without eating a smoked meat sandwich. For shame. Leaving Ottawa- a night in Montreal then an early flight to New York tomorrow AM. And then, finally, my 3 months of travel will be over. New Pornographers on Letterman tonight!

We are seeing the ugly side of life under a conservative government in Canada. This is not how it was supposed to be. Interesting watching the officials in Toronto so quickly try to sweep the G20 mess under a rug- the crazy part is they'll get away with it. Reading about John Dewey, Margaret Mead, and Teachers College. @mariuswatz What's the @chrisoshea debacle? Did I miss something? BTW, I'll be in NYC by Friday - staying for 10 weeks...! @cherrybombc2 Next year, I guess! Feel free to e-mail me as well, if you have questions about that tutorial. Thanks for the phone advice! I need a phone to use in the US for the next 10 weeks. Any ideas about Android devices & monthly plans? Or am I living in fantasy land? I can't believe I'll have to wait another 4 years to have my hopes and dreams crushed. Nice game, Germany. It would be terrible were this game to be decided on that goal that should have been. Thanks, @ben_fry: the next release of Processing for OS X no longer has to quit when you close the last window #nowthatsservice. Philledelphia's terminal 4 bar has a completely unexpected breadth of microbrews on draught. @richshupe definitely! I'm there for 10 weeks so there will be plenty of opportunity... @clothbot just visiting. Have to come back to Canada for a few days for visa reasons... Leaving Boston after an excellent week - big thanks to @ben_fry for his hospitality. I'm headed up to Ottawa for a few days, then to NYC! @mariuswatz I will be posting about it shortly - seems though that most non-crazy sketches run pretty well. Performance is excellent, too - sketches are speedy and responsive. #Processing4Android Building apps with #Processing for #Android is very easy. My mind is racing with all of the possibilities... @quasimondo That quote comes courtesy of @ben_fry, but I'm sure he wouldn't mind... Those eager to dive into Processing & Android might want to wait a few minutes for the next Processing build, which @ben_fry is working on. @Toddicus Hi Todd - fire me an email - my twitter name at my twitter name dot com. "Do not use this code if you're prone to whining about incomplete software that you download for free." @bit101 I'm going to play around with it a bit then write a tutorial. Seems fairly straight-forward, though. I'm digging into Processing for Android. So far, so good - looks like a very easy way to make apps. @bit101 I am still full! And, I think, sweating pure pork fat. The Guardian painfully points out the lopsidedness of the England/Germany rivalry: http://bit.ly/dCXev4 Spoil-sports.

I'd like to warn my German friends that I will start hating them on Saturday afternoon. Depending on the result, it will end Sunday or 2011. Spent the afternoon at Barabasi labs - I think my brain may catch on fire. Amazing people & ideas. Wow. HUGE goal by the USA. I can almost hear people in Boston caring about soccer. Quietly. Just like @flight404 to ruin @ben_fry and I's waffle surprise. We've been working on this for *months*. @ireneros That might be the nicest thing that anyone has ever said to me.

Which is, frankly, too many t-shirts. You have 16 hours to RSVP for my talk tomorrow at IBM Research in Cambridge: http://ibmsocialsoftware.eventbrite.com/ Happy fathers' day to my Dad, @infoparadox. I'll admit I'm disappointed that my Boston friends didn't tell me it was CRAFT BEER fest today and yesterday. I'm at Bukowski's in Boston. I spent a large part of my 20s in a Vancouver bar of the same name. @bit101 Awww... shucks! (Don't forget hairier). Getting ready to head to Boston. Will be there tonight, and staying until the 26th. @MaryShoppins vastly different events. Many less blazer and jeans combos; many more nerds debating Apple vs. Adobe. I can't imagine the advice that Capello is giving the English side right now could be very complicated. Try? I'm keeping #flashbelt alive at the Nomad - getting set for the Ingerland game. MSP folks, come join me! @MaryShoppins Much, much, much longer? I'd like to think Saramago will outlast Perez Hilton... I am in the Minneapolis Central Library, home of Ben Rubin's excellent 'Four Stories' elevator intallation: http://bit.ly/cHvZSy @alisonflood My favourites: Blindness, The Stone Raft, The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis.

Getting set to give my Falshbelt talk. Always a great time!! @blellum Awesome. I'll be doing some more Barabasi promotion in my talk today... Apple remote situation sorted (thanks, @wheniwas19). Anyone at #flashbelt have an Apple remote that I could borrow for an hour at 4:30?

Heading to the Nomad at 1 to watch Germany/Australia. The German contingent is so strong at #flashbelt, I may have to cheer for the aussies. Listening to the new Gaslight Anthem album, finally. I'm a sucker for big, galloping rock'n'roll. I've arrived in MSP - like a lot of regular #flashbelt folks, this city seems like a second home. Happy to be back! “I know in 10 years it will be a junior-high project to build a bacteria." Uh. Huh.

Just venting some frustration. Great to see so many world class football players on the pitch today. And Rob Green, too. I'm on the train for the first leg of my journey to #flashbelt. It's going to be a very long day - at least there's a football break planned I suspect that this is where I'll be watching the England/US game tomorrow in Seattle: http://www.georgeanddragonpub.com/ @mezzoblue I should be there by 7. It seems like #wc2010 is going to be quite the showcase for sports infographics. Twitter viz from the Guardian: http://bit.ly/cUdSq7 Vancouver friends - I'm leaving again tomorrow AM but will be at the @alibiroom tonight for drinks. Join me!! This is one of the nicest little sketches I've seen in #Processing for a while - great work! http://bit.ly/aAgEq3 @ErikGelderblom I think it works best as a compliment to actually watching the game. Imagine something like this (albeit enhanced) on iPad? Live data visualization of sports is really becoming a reality- see this excellent NYTimes tool: http://nyti.ms/cmBJrD (v @paulcarvill) CBC.ca is streaming all 64 of the #wc2010 games - the quality is amazing. Too bad I'll be in the US for the rest of the tournament.

Just had a meeting w/ @emercoleman at the GLA - exciting things are afoot for London and Open Data. I'll be back in Vancouver from the 9th to the 13th to get some work done and have a few meetings. Last day in London, today. @field_io I am going to head to the museum for 3:30 or so... DM me if you are still good to meet up. I've had an entirely spectacular weekend in London. It was always a candidate city but has certainly moved up on the list. @UnitZeroOne I have bought nothing but Gravis bags for the last 5 years (suitcases, backpacks, etc.) and have never been disappointed. I'm sitting in St. Pancras, waiting to meet my Dad (@infoparadox) for a short pint. Strange to meet family 1/2 way around the world. @UnitZeroOne Doesn't have all of the camera compartments, but I love my Gravis Metro. I've owned two over the last 5 years. @sermad Can't do tonight - but sometime before Wednesday, definitely! Fire me an e-mail... @herbkim Thanks, Herb! Will check out the list... @culturalelite Thanks! @JohnathonV Thanks! Will check it out... I'm leaving the peace & quiet of the Peak District for the bustle of London.

I suspect I am doing something wrong, as the same text run through the OpenCalais WP Auto Tagger plugin returns useful results. I'm a bit disappointed with OpenCalais so far.

For those of you who can't wait, this article gives a good overview of Java 5: http://bit.ly/cpjQcR (like @ben_fry says, hello 2004!) @mtchl I agree.

Then I found out it was just a guy who owned a baseball team. Interesting medical story in the NYTimes- for those of you who don't squirm when you hear the term 'fecal transplant': http://nyti.ms/aArQpg Well, Twitter reviews of Terminal 5 were equally ambiguous. I think I'll have to flip a coin. @christinewhuang Thanks! I think I'll give it a pass... even though the band is great. Sub-par venues ruin things. Yelp reviews for Terminal 5 are extraordinarily mixed. Anyone have opinions? I'm thinking of catching the Wolf Parade show there tonight. @nervous_jessica Yes!

Incentive for studios to recycle played-out crap and avoid originality. I figure it's only a matter of time before @MikatheStripper becomes the most-followed poster of infographics on Twitter. @ben_fry I'd buy it.

I am really hoping there won't be a day 3. @garryoakgirl 'To learn more about social media, Microsoft sent several staff members on an externship to Twitter'. I just heard the word 'externship' used for the first time. Good news - it looks like I will be staying in NYC until at least January, gods of immigration willing. @MaryShoppins Can you sacrifice something to get rid of this cold I have? It's entirely inappropriate to be sick in August. You can watch now my talk from @ThinkingDigital in Newcastle online - http://bit.ly/dxl1KW - along with 23 other great talks! Two of the worst words in the english language: summer cold. What did I do to deserve this? Blech. I am extremely jealous of @nickbilton. How come nobody ever delivers me a robot? http://flic.kr/p/8oUpAz Peggy Orenstein gives us a clever, considered take on how using Twitter changes our behaviour: http://nyti.ms/dzwNMz @Rickyars Yes - all of the lectures are free and open to the public. @MaryShoppins And, of course I'd be into speaking at King's - let's do it! I might be in the UK again in the fall, anyway... Pittsburgh! I'll be speaking at the CMU School of Art Lecture Series on Tuesday, October 5th. Save the date! Details to follow... Why spend $$$ on bullshit from social media 'gurus' when you can just go here? http://bit.ly/ci8RVY (via @harrisj @mattwaite) @MaryShoppins And I was JUST thinking that I could use a bit of Welsh rap! Have I mentioned how happy I am with @WebFaction lately? Best shared web host out there - incredible customer service. @MaryShoppins Congratulations! Maybe there'll be a surprise party? NYC has been, thankfully, a bit cooler. And me, a bit less sweaty. Steak with salsa verde, roasted beet & arugula salad with goat cheese. Good to be cooking again. @MaryShoppins Amazing! The way all politicians should be! At State and Lake in Chicago, having a beer and building on some plans. @flight404 food foam always reminds me of spit bugs. Not an association that makes me hungry. Where are you eating? Heading to Chicago for the Processing.Android symposium. God bless you, John Bowers & Roy Wilkins.

Remember, folks - the key to consistency is: consistency. @informatics411 I don't think it's anything... which is probably why I like it! I love this image - http://www.flickr.com/photos/armontesinos/5033947071/in/set-72157624930752473/ Thanks to a commenter on my blog, I was led down the fascinating rabbit hole of Number Stations - http://bit.ly/cWoe7I http://bit.ly/a02R7p @juliandolce Awww... wish I was there. @moritz_stefaner JEALOUS!

It was either cut my hair, or hide out in Amish country with Harrison Ford. What kind of a witness protection program would it be if I posted pictures, on the internet? Short hair. No beard.

Will it stand on its own? @pitchinteractiv Wise. Always trust your instincts. @nora3000 Thank you! Come by the R&D lab next time you're in NYC. Just did a fun interview with @nora3000 for @sparkcbc on foundational tech and the dangers of un-distributing the internet. @nora3000 Of course!

Dean Kamen invented the Segway. Jimi Heseldon recently bought the company. Horror of horrors! Can't get @toxiclibs vectors working with Processing/Android; realizing how much I use this stuff in every project I do. At the Threadless book launch. Seems amazing how much time has passed since the #dreamless days. The Collective Consumption show at 20 Jay St. is great - don't miss it if you're at #DAF. Heading to the Dumbo Arts Festival. New blog post! Processing & Android: Mobile App Dev. Made (Very) Easy - http://bit.ly/dcIKOd I'm writing the first post in a 3-part series of Processing Android tutorials. Should be up later this afternoon. We've talked about a 'Cyberwar' for decades - not it appears that it's a reality. Scary, scary, scary. http://bit.ly/aKZWRJ/2 (via @golan) @scottjanousek Definitely. Clearly New York didn't get the memo about summer being over. @sgentiluomo No maker faire for me - busy weekend. But let's get together soon! @r8lobster Welcome! Let me know if you have time to meet up at some point while you're here - would be good to connect. @mcnallyjackson Cyber-damnit! Of course I'm stuck at cyber-work. It has been an absolute pleasure to work with the ultra-caffeinated super statistician Mark Hansen (@cocteau) for the last month. I'm having fun playing with my Plumage Android app. Will show a near-final version next week at Processing.Android - http://bit.ly/aTlk9X @MargaretAtwood Seems to me a ladder of severed mens' heads would be slippery & awkward. A ladder of severed mens legs, on the other hand... @harrisj You forgot the BEEP BEEP BEEP in front of that. @gwerker Did you skip Hippie class? It recharges your bio-shield, man. Pivot interface seems limited (boxes and histograms) - but the concept and underlying tech seem solid. Pivot is quite impressive. Exploratory image-based biz tool w/ SeaDragon tech. Delivered via Silverlight. I'm about to see a demo from the Microsoft folks of Pivot, their tool for exploring big data: http://www.getpivot.com/. Will report. Comparing weather reports, today is a day that I'm fairly content with my YVR -&gt; NYC move. Going to Dumbo Arts Festival? Be sure to catch @randomnumbernu & @clairenicole's "Collective Consumption" http://ow.ly/2IKWw (v @mariuswatz) @nervous_jessica Sounds like a perfect format! Let me know if it gets recorded - or if you publish slides somewhere. Take it from NASA - tonight's Harvest moon will be extra 'harvesty' - http://bit.ly/djmoEm Excellent review of @reas @brysonian and @LUSTnl's book "FORM+CODE" by the equally excellent @serial_consign -  http://bit.ly/bIPATI It's ridiculous how much the Microsoft Surface table looks like a giant iPad on a pedestal. @shashashasha Thanks! Really enjoyed your presentation as well. @serial_consign Could use a bit of colour-coding- but it actually looks like it serves its purpose well! Of course, it's not going to help. @flight404 You are a wizard! You should get a pointy hat. And a staff. Great talks tonight at #NYVIZ. I feel a little guilty for not actually showing work... @drhypercube Which of course leads to the question - which one? @jennifergardy Tragically, no. No brownies from Kristoff, either. There was a bake sale at the NYT today, which of course made me want to listen to Sebadoh. @bit101 Algae, and fungally-enhanced algae! It's the future. I have never met an ethnolichenologist. I would like to, though. @nervous_jessica Lichen post! Yes! My mom used to use lichens a source for dyes for textiles. Actually, going back and actually counted, I've read/seen 9. I think I've read or seen about 5 items from the 50 in The Atlantic Tech Canon: http://bit.ly/9CNgJe How about you? Just got a copy of Andrew Glassner's 'Processing for Visual Artists'. It's a big book, printed in full colour - looks to be very in-depth. Reminder: I'm giving a short presentation tomorrow at the NYC Data Visualization & Infographics meetup: http://bit.ly/9lGUbG Read about Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's new work in this @WiredUK article: http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-09/20/rafael-lozano-hemmer Appropriate that Flickr's 5 billionth image was from Vancouver, where Flickr was born. http://bit.ly/as1YVs (link via @brainpicker) Jonathan Harris is looking for amazing programmer ninjas to help him complete a new project: http://number27.org/ninjas.html @SteveMartinToGo “How’s the “screenplay” going, Steve?” @MargaretAtwood I hear the Tories are planning to run a rutabaga, to split the root vegetable vote. It was great to discover today that @brainpicker is just as charming (and informative!) in real life as she is on Twitter. @juliaxgulia Don't worry; I often don't realize I'm me, either. Congratulations on the show... I enjoyed it. David Abir's 'Intersect No. 2' is the class of #TLS10 D4 @MargaretAtwood Unfortunately the biggest one (DEF CON) was about a month ago.

This week is crazy - but let's plan something soon... next week, perhaps? @sermad I didn't right after - but I did just now. Great film, all around. @jobemakar Interesting - though it seems bizarre to remake a film that seemed so near to perfect. A follow-up: fullscreen, full framerate non-compressed HD video playback is possible in Processing with GLGraphics & GSVideo libraries. I watched 'Let the Right One In' last night. Best Swedish anti-bullying vampire film I've seen in years. Wow. Columbia's new Master of Computational Journalism. http://to.pbs.org/awJkOV (via @golan) Bizarre that I'm getting better GL rendering performance from my 2.33 MacBook w/ATI 1600 than the 2x2.8 MacPro with 3 2600XTs. #whatthe The mystery airship wave of 1897 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_airship (via @kate_armstrong) Is there a reasonable solution for playing HD-size video in Processing, or am I living in fantasy-land?

A set of random numbers, for instance, is almost never a suitable fake dataset. .@eyeseast Yes - I mean 'fake' as in not from the actual project - not 'fake' as in randomly generated. A useful skill for the beginning of data viz projects is being able to create suitable fake datasets. You've got to get down to mock up.

I've just discovered logs from an super-geeky MOO I was a regular on in the mid-nineties. Embarrassment/nostalgia ratio is surprisingly low. @sgentiluomo Yes, you should! Nice Processing tutorial by @make on webcam color detection: http://bit.ly/cQXwx5 Favourite all-time street find: http://bit.ly/a8fmTe I love how almost every word is spelled wrong, apart from the 17-letter one at the end.

Fascinating, detailed data-sheet on the MTA's subway car 'rolling stock' - http://www.thejoekorner.com/cars/NYC-Subway-Car-Datasheet.pdf Great NYTimes comment: 'In the fish world, the expression used is "swimming under the Fonz".' Cool that Google has an interactive logo on its home page today - could use a bit of parameter tuning, though. @CaptPhunkosis Yes - epic fail. I never want to stand in a line again. Getting ready to head to Governers Island to eat myself silly - Food Truck Fest! http://meanredproductions.com/2368 @misshemmett I am enjoying it. I think...! Incredible - an illustration for every page of Gravity's Rainbow. Here's page 186: http://bit.ly/9tyUTL (thanks, @harrisj!) I'm going to be honest with you. Gravity's Rainbow is kicking my ass. In case you ever need to know - it takes 3 hours and 32 minutes to walk from 110th st.  to the tip of manhattan. How could I not know about this screening of M*A*S*H today by @filmlinc? Looks like it's sold out, though. Curses! Rebuilding Plumage (http://www.blprnt.com/plumage) in Processing - going to build an Android app using the feather-building algorithm. @MarkBusse The gender metric is a hard one to measure. But the 90/10 figure is about right. Best part of my job so far? Amazing lunch-time conversations with @cocteau, @zimbalist, & guest eaters. Today: Reproducibility in research. Great talk by WNYC's John Keefe about using mobile devices (particularly SMS) for community journalism. #to Our Google friend at #to thinks mobile apps are a stop-gap until browsers on devices get better. Question is, how long is the gap? I'm impressed by @twilio demo at TimesOpen. Easy phone/sms enabled apps. Seems like it could have a lot of utility for artists & activists. I love Moritz Stefaner's Map Your Moves - simple exploration of where NYers moved in the last decade: http://bit.ly/bxEfaW Looking forward to @timesopen tonight - will cram my brain full of mobile & geolocation madness, and see what sticks. Come to our exhibit tonight in SF.  4 types of 3D printing! iPad apps! Ceramics! Lamps! And more! http://bit.ly/aa06BY (v @nervous_jessica) @alexismadrigal Great quote.

You are welcome any time. @mattupstate Thanks! And yes - let's do beers sometime soon... I'm all moved in into my new DUMBO apartment. It's possible that I may have the best view in the city. Come over for a drink! I am Internet-free for the time being - if you need to get in touch, DM! @tensafefrogs I'd go again, for sure. Hell, I'd go every night, until I died fat, broke, and happy. @jacqui I now have a new goal in life. @jacqui I will be a long ways from Bedford - in DUMBO. Which I think I actually lose hipster points for. This time tomorrow I will be a Brooklynite. #hipsterlevelup Nice feature in Fast Company on data-driven art in the excellent new FORM+CODE book: http://bit.ly/c2HmI1 @waxpraxis The crispy pig ear at Spotted Pig will have you forgetting about the steam buns. And I know - I had them two weeks ago. @mattupstate I remember very little from FFWD Austin in '06! But the cab ride rings some sort of a bell... My restaurant advice for those visiting NYC now consists of two simple words: Spotted Pig. Hands down the best meal I've had in the city. Incredible line-up for November's @NYCVIZ meetup, including speakers from Tableau, the NYTimes, Bestiario & TargetPoint http://bit.ly/c4qgAW @Egnaro I'm almost too terrified to listen to it. It's far too early for a drink. Oh, Toronto. You poor thing. Transcript of CBC As It Happens interview with new mayor Rob Ford: http://bit.ly/cncb5E @zachlieberman Congratulations! Well-deserved. @tararobertson Even dogs think that Gordon Campbell is a douchebag. Two years on Twitter today. Happy twirthday to me? Geocities in a 1TB torrent (a very glittery 1TB torrent). If no excellent art comes of this, I'll cry.  http://bit.ly/av6yuZ (via @hmason) I liked that 'Good Morning!' was shown at one point, while the voice-over was talking about 'bad visualizations'. Bad is more fun than good. Finally found the time to watch the Journalism in the Age of Data video; great job by all involved: http://bit.ly/9CczOF A gem from PopTech - David Eagleman on Possibilianism: http://bit.ly/cyGy8a @bengl3rt Well, MetaCarta will do that for you. Yahoo Placemaker may, as well. @simon_daly Maybe 10% of what I do could be achieved using an off-the-shelf package. @simon_daly If you're using standard techniques for viz, yes, the packaged solutions are good. Novel techniques, however, need novel tools. @bengl3rt Good Morning! (the one with the globe) is already open-sourced here: http://blog.blprnt.com/source-code-tutorial @bengl3rt The problem with Just Landed is that the MetaCarta stuff no longer works (they've changed the API, and it's not free anymore). That last link, while focused on getting scientists to open source code, is equally relevant to media artists. Nick Barnes in Nature "If your code is good enough to do the job, it's good enough to be released" http://bit.ly/apvKh3 (via @yy) @brendandawes The economy, or the analysis? Or both?

Octopi are terminal spawners - males like Paul die shortly after producing spermatophores (sperm packets), which can be up to 1 metre long. @ben_fry How'd I know that was coming! I can do that, certainly. I really like http://sketchpad.cc/ - but it would be nice if it could incorporate tabbed windows for code the same way Processing does. @shashashasha Haven't tried tinygrab. As far as live-coding is concerned, would love to try something using http://sketchpad.cc/ I use: 

void keyPressed() { 
	if (key == 's') save( "outs/MyProject" + hour() + "_" + minute() + "_" + second() + ".png"); 
} @golan @reas @ben_fry I think it's easy enough to implement as is - would be cool to see it included in the beginners' tutorials, though. In case you need a reason to attend tomorrow's SPEED SHOW, here's a gorgeous preview from @mariuswatz: http://bit.ly/che1eZ When I'm starting a new project in Processing, the 1st thing I do is set up a key-stroke image save function so I can document iteration.

Excellent birthday with a myriad of marvelously intelligent friends - great conversation is always at the top of my wish list. Thank you! @seb_ly The GLTexture object in the GLGraphics library extends PImage, so you can use it in the same way. There's an example in the lib... Heading out for some Sunday afternoon birthday drinks shortly. NYC friends - join me here: http://www.bierinternational.com/ .@tzvister is Looking for a Processing Graphic Library developer for a quick paid job. @seb_ly Also also, enabling 4X smoothing makes things look generally better: hint(ENABLE_OPENGL_4X_SMOOTH) @seb_ly It's also fairy easy using the GLGraphics library to render GL textures in place of PImages, which might help. Faster, too. @seb_ly When using alpha images it sometimes helps to turn depth sorting off... hint(DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST) @seb_ly Hey - what are you trying to do? Basic GL use is really really easy. For more complex stuff, see the GLGraphics library. Waffles at Amy Ruth's, reading an interview with Lee Smolin on 'The Trouble With Physics'. Excellent Sunday start.

I think I'm just getting over it now. @bit101 Excellent! This beautiful video captures perfectly the heartbreak of saying goodbye to an animal that you love: http://vimeo.com/8191217. Devastating. What an honour it was to speak with Paola Antonelli, Lisa Strausfeld, Brooke Singer & Tahir Hemphill last night @  #VisualizingMarathon2010. @bit101 The maggot art video would have been much better with a Cannibal Corpse soundtrack. @taliesinb For some reason your comment on my Neural Darwinism post disappeared due to some kind of WP error - do you mind re-posting?

He's a city dog - doesn't know better. Let's hope he's learned his lesson. @ghostpressbed Now he's had skunk and porcupine. So far he's steered clear of the moose. If you aren't coming to see me speak at Eyebeam tonight, you'd better be going to this generative art show at Devotion: http://bit.ly/LXMXN My dog just found out about the downside of farm life - in the form of 20+ porcupine quills embedded in the tender regions of his face.

Quick blog post:: Neural Darwinism - An Idea Reborn? http://blog.blprnt.com/blog/blprnt/neural-darwinism-an-idea-reborn For everyone asking about the source code for my Text Comparison Tool - I will get it up on my site this weekend!

Calvin: http://amzn.to/bVY4As The big failing point of Neural Darwinism - a lack of replication - is addressed in this brand new paper: http://bit.ly/au7INO Reading about Neural Darwinism. You have to admit that 'Neural Darwinist' would look pretty great on a business card. @bit101 It will be, when they're done! Tinier and tinier ants take tinier and tinier bites... Twitter is veritably overflowing with #RWPT - Rich White Person Tragedy. Leaf cutter ants are marvelous. So is this photograph by Hungarian photographer Bence Máté: http://bit.ly/9t1nlY Thrilled to be speaking tmrw night @ Eyebeam w/ Paola Antonelli, Lisa Strausfeld, Beth Comstock, Brooke Singer, Tahir Hemphill & Adam Bly.

He is really scary. Would love to see him thrown off the team, but the coach really likes him. @misshemmett @stevemynett I second the vote for White Noise. I am 30 pages from the end right now - fantastic. Bravo, Google! 'It Gets Better' contribution from employees: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYLs4NCgvNU It's perhaps a little bit disturbing that the prison bus is parked outside of my new apartment in Google Street View. Just over two weeks until FITC Edmonton - my birthplace! http://bit.ly/cbLdyH @jennifergardy You'd better! @AmyBaxstreet Or sooner! Trapper takes Manhattan! I think there's a feature film in there somewhere. @factoryfactory I looked at another apartment a while ago that said it was in DUMBO, but was certainly not. @seb_ly I will definitely plan around your schedule! I will post details about Processing workshops in NYC on my blog, soon. Will be running level 1, level 2, and data viz sessions. @rcbth Thanks! It's literally Down Under the Manhattan Bridge. There will be a house-warming. Fear not. @factoryfactory quite literally in DUMBO. The sun shines through! Hope is not lost! I got the apartment. So very exciting. Also means that Processing workshops will start in NYC. I was incredibly impressed by the hilarious, eloquent and exceedingly inspirational Junot Diaz last night. If you haven't read him yet - do. @flight404 Oh, I'm sure it's in the Zone. We are all in the Zone. Promise, then heartbreak. The eternal pattern of apartment hunting. Junot Diaz: The arts are where all the things that make it good to be human are collected. Junot Diaz: You can be good at something that you find incredibly difficult. Puny's Shad Petosky is blatantly over-humble in this business feature: http://bit.ly/cNhc17 (Shad is one of my favourite humans) I'm not sure how I missed this spot-on brilliant review of The Social Network by Lawrence Lessig: http://bit.ly/bfaC0c (via @daeaves) I've never been to a hack day, largely because I'm afraid that everyone will find out how bad of a coder I really am. Then point and laugh. Something tells me we're going to see a lot of 30 second clips of people being punched in the face: http://bit.ly/drLJIA (v @alexislloyd) New York artist Cory Arcangel turns up the glockenspiel dial on classic Springsteen tunes: http://bit.ly/dn81fX It's hard to type with crossed-fingers. @waxpraxis Sounds exactly like my Monday, last week. Luckily I managed to find an admittedly hacky fix. You know, as opposed to the non-nerdy Galactus-related questions. Tonight I am going to see Mireya Navarro interview Junot Diaz - I'm dying to ask him nerdy Galactus-related questions. Spelling mistakes on Twitter are like lost hikers in nat. parks. The vultures always get them before the rescue team does. (via @simonpegg) This weekend I made the decision to stay in New York for a while. Seems like the right place to call home. Putting together a 30-minute process talk for Friday's @VisualizingOrg marathon launch event: http://www.visualizing.org/marathon2010 The Magical Properties of Everyday Numbers: A fun and fascinating look at numbers in our lives: http://nyti.ms/afjhVG @whaleforest Yes - part two is nearly finished. Should go up sometime this week. Great interview (and sexy picture) of Twitter's @cbrumelle in the Georgia Straight - local boy done good! http://bit.ly/9zy3ol Such a great idea for tech types to give back to the community: help underfunded arts organizations by applying your skills. I'm at Project Matchmaker, where arts organizations are looking to be paired with developers & designers. Scavenged Halowe'en costume ideas are harder to come upon when your worldly possessions fit in a suitcase. @NYVIZ At the new beer garden, Bier, at 114th and Fred D. We should grab a pint some time. The first stage of the project I've been working on with the NYTimes is done - I'll be able to show some of it in 2 weeks or so. The end of the network diagram hairball? Ambitious claim from UBC's Martin Krzywinski: http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/linnet/ (via @generatorx) Just had a remarkably decent pint of London Pride in Harlem. @MercuryLoungeNY Are those new tickets only available at ML? The site still sells sold out... Eye candy is fine, but you need more eye vegetables. (via @dresdencodak) @pitchinteractiv I'm camera-shy. You know that. Not surprisingly, OKCupid doesn't seem to consider the ethical implications of their posts about race and gender. At the @NYViZ meetup. Interesting talk by the OKCupid guys about their excellent dating data analysis. I'm off for a curry ramen at Rai Rai Ken, then @NYVIZ meetup. Noodles, then numbers. I have been in Gotham for nearly four months and have yet to see Batman. Or a goat. @mezzoblue Not sure about their beer list, but the food is absolutely amazing. @mezzoblue Did you make it to Les Papilles last time? If not, you should go...! Speaking of @eyembeam_org, I'll be talking there on the 22nd as part of the @visualizingOrg Visualizing Marathon launch event. @alexismadrigal Hah! Funny to see the headline change after a tweet. Surely I get a beer for that? Patrick Feaster uses clever custom software to play back the world's oldest recorded sounds: http://bit.ly/bm2Q4o (via @alexismadrigal ) Curses! The @eyebeam_org residency and fellowship applications are due tomorrow. Why do these things always sneak up on me? Just scooped the last spot for tonight's @nyviz meetup, which I had forgotten about until 5 minutes ago. See you there? @NYCcyn Come and visit more often! I love this initiative to connect NYC developers with arts organizations: Project Matchmaking - http://bit.ly/aISRDk (via @brainpicker) @flashfreaker @pitchinteractive - Interesting story about head injury: http://nyti.ms/92VpcU Hungry for more Processing for Android examples? Check out @codeanticode's latest post: http://bit.ly/a4hawk #PDroid @benhammersley What are the rules? A simple 'drink for each miner'? @geranyl Yes! It's ridiculous. I've had to bill for work for more than a decade now, and I can say with 100% certainly that the WORST people at paying up are universities. @REAS Great idea. I'd love to see it when it's done... have been thinking along similar lines. I could hardly agree more with this post about designer snobbery and the new (old?) Gap logo: http://bit.ly/aGdcCf The best conceptual art on the internet is not being made by conceptual artists. This is beautiful, on so many levels. A 16bit computer built 'physically' inside of the game minecraft. http://bit.ly/aKLX5K (via @TEDchris) Fantastic comment on the culture of misogyny that Facebook came out of, from Aaron Sorkin (commenting on a blog post!) http://bit.ly/bXb4CH @alexismadrigal Something tells me he might have some insider knowledge on late-night drinking and writing. @pitchinteractiv I am in South Harlem, but am right on a good transit line. @alexismadrigal I love this - "But the so-called citizen journalism is the spewings and rantings of very drunk people late at night." □ □ □ □ □ □ □
(I finished Gravity's Rainbow last week. It took 2 months and resulted in roughly equal loss of sanity and enlightenment) Now everybody— The #Processing flickr group is always a good place to find new projects- like @toxi's 3D unwrapper for digi-fab: http://bit.ly/bfLKgh Cute use of simple wandering code with #Processing to make a Blue Cheese generator: http://bit.ly/a9RjOd @pitchinteractiv Excellent! I'll be here! Heather is also talking (presumably about robots) at Friday's TedXGotham event: http://tedxgotham.org/events/ There are robots aplenty at Carnegie Mellon - according to @heatherknight's nifty @robotcensus. Read about it here: http://bit.ly/dbfgWn When this project is over, I definitely have to buy @toxi and @codeanticode a present. @rcbth I figured some other geek must have caught it - it just wasn't in my Twitter stream. Which is, honestly, the only place I get news. All of the discussion I've seen about 10/10/10 today has missed out on the sheer amazingness of the date as a binary number. #wemissyoudna @paulmmay Yes, I'd say that's a very likely possibility! Why am I inside working on this gorgeous (albeit turkey-less) New York day? #programmerslament @seb_ly Seb - I'm no 3D guy but there are a tonne of librares to import .OBJ files, .3ds, etc... http://bit.ly/9sIoae Any #Processing folks know if it's possible to 'escape'  drawing operations from the camera with OCD? Trying to render stuff 'out of scene'. @heatherknight By the way, three cheers for sprays of weighted dots! That describes what I've been working on all day pretty much exactly. @heatherknight From the age of three, we are all subjected to extensive, state-mandated brainwashing. It's the price we pay for health care. Hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey hockey. After a long day, it's dinner, then Blind Tiger, then home. Time scale is not clear yet. I live this city. Hold Steady show. Free. Friday. @QueRicco Hi Kristina - send me an e-mail if you haven't already. I'll be sending out links to source this weekend. I'm going down to the Apple store in SoHo to check out what I can of the Hold Steady... if anyone wants to go for a beer, DM me. My weekend just got a lot better - nothing like solving a big, critical issue at 4:57pm on a Friday. @heatherknight Yes! Thank-you for introducing me to your robot. See you in a week or so, hopefully! Delays delays delays delays delays. Not a winning travel day. Here's a preview of @ThinkingDigital for 2011 - the first 8 speakers announced: http://bit.ly/9SnQOD Check out the amazing speaker list for @TedXKids, next month in Ottawa: http://bit.ly/afWo7t Yes, I will be speaking with RAFFI. Thanks to @serial_consign, who made my day infinitely better with FIBONACCI PIGEONS! http://bit.ly/a5KtNC @serial_consign YES! I love it. One of my favourite information visualization pieces - The Secret Lives of Numbers: http://www.turbulence.org/Works/nums/ http://code.google.com/p/joons-renderer/ looks like an excellent new library for #Processing: raytrace, sunflow, render (via @REAS) I'm listening to @golan give a short talk about his work - an unexpected treat during my short stay in Pittsburgh. @WaldronFaulkner Moved entirely to GPU-accelerated graphics. Using @codeanticode's awesome GLGraphics library. Thanks to advice from @codeanticode, I've upped the framerate on my mega-data viz project from 8fps to 50fps. And that's on my old MacBook. @vlh Tomorrow, maybe! This morning I'm embarrassed to say that I had a Starbucks breakfast sandwich. Good morning, Pittsburgh. One last reminder for you that I'll be speaking at CMU tonight at 5pm: http://bit.ly/9vNhyD Awesome to see people making quick, fun things with Processing for Android: http://fredtruman.com/processing-for-android #PDroid Goodbye Chicago - hello Pittsburgh. In-depth mathematical analysis of drawdown patterns for 3-harness weaving:  http://www.combinatorics.org/Volume_15/PDF/v15i1r1.pdf @tanbob Printed, I'm sure. But the patterns really remind me of weaving drawdowns. Great to hear from all of my Canadian friends who are listening to CBC Radio on a Sunday afternoon. @jamesalliban I believe that the sessions from the Processing.Android symposium will be webcast - keep an eye on ProcessingAndroid.org The Cing project that I mentioned yesterday will be available for public release in about 3 months. Holder page for now: http://www.cing.cc/ Want to support Processing - AND pick up attractive members of your preferred gender(s)? Buy a Processing shirt: http://bit.ly/c9aY3g Visualizing Marathon 2010 - A 24hr student data visualization competition: http://www.visualizing.org/marathon2010 (via @bldblog) My closed laptop fell off of my bed this morning. Onto my glasses. Dented laptop, broken glasses. Nice way to start a morning. Need new tea towels? Fantastic designs for the Textile Museum in Tilburg by Pieke Bergmans (via @jeremytubbs) From The Guardian, how to be a data journalist http://is.gd/fIzIp Related documentary: http://is.gd/fyS0A (via @brainpicker) @scottjanousek Thanks for the thoughts about projectors, btw. I'll send you an e-mail. @scottjanousek Yes - just finishing for today. One mre day tomorrow. Cing is an open-source project which uses Processing syntax to compile C++ apps. Seems promising. No website, yet. I wonder if 3M's new Pocket Projectors could be hacked to run Processing? Daniel Sauter is demo-ing the Ketai library for Processing Android, which simplifies access to device sensors & camera. #PDroid How have I not seen iProcessing before? Compiles Processing sketches for iPhone: http://www.luckybite.com/iprocessing/ Interesting post and visualization by Ali Fisher on the social impact of releasing information (ie. Wikileaks): http://bit.ly/biZIMx I'll be on CBC Radio tomorrow & wednesday, on Spark (@sparkcbc). You can listen to the episode online, too: http://www.cbc.ca/spark/ Cool to see my Processing Android post on Hack a Day - seems a lot of people are joining in on the fun! #PDroid I suspect that the beer in Chicago is somehow poisoned. Wow. The 3D functionality coming to Processing (currently only in A3D) is amazing. The A3D rendered in the new release of Processing (0191) is 100% OpenGL GPU accelerated. Wow. The improvements coming to 3D in Processing are truly amazing. Drastic performance improvements, new features. Very, very exciting. Shaders will be coming at some point for A3D - but not implemented currently. #PDroid Andres' GLGraphics library is one of the most useful and powerful additions to Processing. Very excited to see Andres Colubri talk about the future of OpenGL & Processing. Just posted Spark 122 with @mgeist @BillStarnaud @blprnt @hughmcguire @rmazar and more: http://bit.ly/9TR6lA ^dm (via @sparkcbc) Getting 40 people up and running with the Android SDK was a bit painful - but great to see them all make their own apps with #PDroid! @pitchinteractiv It is going to be webcast. Either live or posted after the event (depending on technical issues). Will keep you posted. @pitchinteractiv Clearly you don't pay attention to my Twitter feed!! I'm reasonably certain the bartender tapped the keg of Dogfish Chicory Stout just so I'd break my 1 beer rule. Jerk. @flight404 Alas, I know no one from the Antarctic Desk. I think they're down in the basement... @SteveMynett You owe me a beer, and I owe you one. Now you just have to come to NYC. @flight404 Group show at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station,? @SteveMynett I'm scared. @SteveMynett It ruled. I don't miss a lot of things about Vancouver (yet), but I miss cold Tuesday nights, and Shindig! at the Rail. Jokes for beer! Looks like I'll be speaking at O'Reilly's Strata Conference in Santa Clara, Feb 1-3rd: http://bit.ly/fJccFH I just tweened for the first time since 2007. It was good. #addkeyframe Wondering what Assange and Wikileaks are really up to? This essay is a must-read: http://bit.ly/gpSICG BOTACON is a conference all about robots. Which is, we can all agree, awesome. (& @heatherknight will be there) : http://www.botacon.com/ @infosthetics I will let you guys know as soon as I have something that can be shown publicly. @infosthetics Nothing, yet - look for a public release of information on the project in the next couple of weeks. My Dad (@infoparadox ) is such a trooper - one day after surgery, he's tweeting away! @selfishchimp I may be in California in Feb., but it will likely be a quick visit. For now I think workshops will be NYC-based... One last space is available for my December 22nd Data Viz workshop. http://blog.blprnt.com/workshops Ken Perlin designs the world's smallest legible font - 5 pixels high: http://bit.ly/f6S8kV (via @kennelliott) It's been a while since I raved about how good the How to Think About Science podcast series is. Life-changing. http://bit.ly/dwSH1I @cocteau Love Peter Galison! I read Einstein's Clocks, Poincaré's Maps this summer. Also, his interview here is great: http://bit.ly/dwSH1I Apparently that same graphic was used this morning on German ARD news, as well. @taleoftales I couldn't disagree more. Funny to see my quickest #cablegate sketch at the top of a @doctorow column on @boingbong - http://bit.ly/g8onO7 I didn't get very far with my #cablegate plans tonight - here's why: http://www.flickr.com/photos/blprnt/5219480503/ @yblumberg The sources are on left and right - so the terms get positioned horizontally depending on weighted frequency. @yblumberg Horizontal position is. Vertical will be related to date - working on that right now. The goal here is to make these comparison clouds animate over time, so we can see the changing issues. We'll see if that actually works. One more (Beijing and Seoul): http://www.flickr.com/photos/blprnt/5219128953/ #cablegate Back to work on #cablegate visualizations. Trying some comparison clouds between cable source (there are 275). http://bit.ly/hQZvi2 @jays0n Would definitely get ugly. The fake data would have to be good enough to pass very close examination. Passed to WL via a 3rd party. Wow - CanPop Flashback! Listening to Pluto on @cbcradio3. Thanks, Chris! If the US wanted to discredit WikiLeaks, the best way would be feed them a fake (or partially fake) - but convincing - data set. Workshop update: Level 1 - Sold out. Level 2 - 3 spots left. Data Viz - 2 spots left. Worse, even, than this horribly limited, poorly designed and clunky search interface on the CBC site: http://bit.ly/dVNWtO Terrible reporting by the CBC on #cablegate: http://bit.ly/eBJT7f. At they end they mix together statements from @Wikileaks and the NYTimes. @cms_ 2 spots left for the 22nd. @taleoftales Coding == bad? I'm not huge fan of the word (makes it sound more mysterious than it is) but surely the process isn't evil. If you are a craft beer fan (particularly if you live in BC), you should check out http://barleymowat.com/ @wheniwas19 My thanksgiving spread - @tensafefrogs was the official photographer. And bringer of pies. New Processing users: the Troubleshooting page on the wiki is a great resource to help you solve strange problems: http://bit.ly/gSCPy9 @humphd I haven't seen anything in JS yet that does real live-coding - everything I've seen requires a reset. Should be doable, though. And the obligatory after-dinner drinks on the roof: http://www.flickr.com/photos/tensafefrogs/5208946511/ This was my Thanksgiving - http://www.flickr.com/photos/tensafefrogs/5209531642/in/photostream/ (photo by @tensafefrogs) Live coding in Processing! Very very exciting demo from Florian Jenett's new project TWEAKER - http://bit.ly/dG3tJW (v @jensfranke) Fascinating - the NYTimes received #cablegate data from The Guardian, not from @wikileaks: http://nyti.ms/gpY4lC @harrisj reads like it's straight out of Absurdistan. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdistan_(novel) While most digital artists struggle to keep thin, the ever-svelte @flight404 spends evenings fattening himself up: http://bit.ly/gN3qYA Congratulations to @mariuswatz, who co-curated the NODE10 festival in Frankfurt. It looks like it was an amazing show - http://bit.ly/eFDKke I saw the original whiteboard sketch for this @mccandelish info-structure diagram yesterday, while visiting @brainpicker. Interesting exchange between Julian Assange and US government officials prior to the #cablegate releases: http://nyti.ms/gqyUEj For the record, Processing plays fairly nicely with Google Fusion Tables - you can query SQL-style and get back result sets. My #cablegate visualizations will get going again this evening - I'll also release the source for the system as it's working so far. I have some ideas for useful exploratory tools, but I simply don't have the energy for an all-nighter. #oldmanjer I think Sunday has defeated me - but I've posted some of my process sketches from the #cablegate data here: http://bit.ly/e0hljw I'm doing everything I can.

And stop calling me Shirley.

(RIP Leslie Neilson) Surely there must be something you can do. @andrew_mahon I haven't seen one yet, apart from through the Wikileaks search interface. May be scrapeable... @andrew_mahon I am using the one from the Guardian: http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/nov/29/wikileaks-cables-data Basic basic basic test to see if the data is coming in properly - http://twitpic.com/3b6orl #cablegate @mtchl I'm just poking around for now - plenty of room in the pool! Turns out to be not an issue, since I don't really care about the addresses. Onward. Rats. Running into some annoying issues with commas in the CSV return. About to do some broad visualizations to see what it all looks like. #cablegate I've used the Google Fusion APIs and Processing to get a delimited text file of the summary-level #cablegate data. 251,288 cables. @selfishchimp The full database seems to only be available (for now) through the wikileaks search interface. Trying to get the Google Fusion Tables API working with Processing to query The Guardian's WikiLeaks release. Trying to get the WikiLeaks data from the Guardian's Data Blog - but Google's servers seem to be swamped. Munich designer @flaccus has made a huge print using my tree.growth source which includes all of the Processing code: http://bit.ly/gcGtzl @flight404 their wifi signals are being blocked by a dense cloud of bad cologne. This bar just took a turn for the douche. @shashashasha seems like a decent place - and 100m from my place... I'm at 68 Jay St. Hate to get all 4 square in you, but I'm still scouting for DUMBO friends. On a related note, thanks to my Level 2 workshopees today - it was a fun day! Now I'm off to find food in DUMBO. Again. Level 1 - January 8th. Level 2 - January 15th. Level 3 - January 22nd. Only 1 spot left for January's Processing Level 1 workshop. A few left for Level 2 - 3 left for Data Viz. http://blog.blprnt.com/workshops Just wondering what people or groups would be exciting for you to see presenting at an event. Trying to think outside of the usual suspects. Question for all of you creative code & hardware types: Who would you love to see at a conference? Wildcards welcome...! January Processing workshops are starting to fill up; act quick if you don't want to wait until February! http://blog.blprnt.com/workshops I hope I'm not breaking some kind of unwritten rule by being productive on the day after Thanksgiving. #strangerinastrangeland The world's best nonagenarian athlete, Olga Kotelko, lives in Vancouver! Who knew? http://nyti.ms/hg8i7E Is it traditional to go to sleep at 10:30 on Thanksgiving? I hope so. Hey @ACNewman - I'm looking forward to the T5 show on the 6th - far cry from Richards! Will be my 1st NP show outside of Vancouver. What an excellent night of decadence (and restraint). A perfect initiation into the American thanksgiving tradition. Thank you, America! The @timesopen blog has posted a review of last week's Big Bata event, with a sneak-peak screenshot of our viz tool: http://nyti.ms/jqYIG In keeping with this year's entertainment trends, I'm making a 3D turkey tomorrow. It might be too early for Christmas carols, but it's never too early for HTML 5 snow - IN 3D! (courtesy of @seb_ly ) - http://bit.ly/hgNTGm I think a much better term regarding #openkinect is 'hijacking'. If anything that's what we're doing, we're hijacking #kinect. (via @memotv) @waxpraxis I may try this stuffing recipe this year, though: http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/detail.asp?docid=26407 @waxpraxis My stand-by is no-brine, flipped once, apples & sage in the cavity, apple cider gravy. Stuffing cooked separate w/ duck fat. @mattupstate I have done both, with turkeys from the same farm - wasn't a discernible difference. Do you you brine? I don't. Season well early in the day; flip the bird once during roasting. Easy & perfect. Figured out the problem that had been bugging me for 8 hours today on the 25 minute subway ride. Hello, full frame rate! @andrewdotdobson The most complicated math I really ever use is simple trig. @blellum Not sure, yet - seems a long way away! Note that prices have increased a bit to compensate for smaller class sizes. I've announced January dates for my Processing workshops: http://blog.blprnt.com/workshops - Level 1: 8th, Level 2: 15th, Viz: 22nd. Conrad Wolfram is one of 5 new speakers announced for @ThinkingDigital - in case you needed another reason to go to this great UK event. Face.com's facial recognition API has a Java client library - seems ripe for building a Processing library! http://bit.ly/hAoImX We had Peter Norvig up for a tour of the R&D labs this morning - he liked my Processing shirt. @bitchwhocodes Of course... I read the first 4 before the movie - haven't read #5 or #6 yet. I watched Scott Pilgrim vs. The World for the second time last night. Even epic-er with repeated viewing. Thanks, @edgarwright! @icathing Yes - from this site: http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=29817&refer=&units=metric Yearly freezing days are a different story, though: 75 for NYC and 46 for Vancouver. OK. That's it. Weather comparison finished. I wouldn't have guessed that Vancouver, on average,   sees more (7) below-zero days in November than NYC (4). It's 23° warmer here than it is in Vancouver. Vancouver is 16° below its Nov average; NYC is 6° above. Hey @brainpicker - welcome to NYC! Dutch machine literally "prints" stone and brick roads on location. Insane. http://ow.ly/3eheG (via @coreformula @mariuswatz) Cool! ITP student Eric Mika working on Real-Time web services library for #Processing. http://bit.ly/gelJ5J (via @shiffman) And yes, for those asking, I'll be running another set of workshops in January. Dates will be announced this week. If you are interested in the open Processing Level 2 spot - please e-mail me (blprnt at blprnt). I have one open spot for Saturday's Processing Level 2 workshop. Get in touch if you'd like to attend! Listening to Jamie Oliver on the CBC. #mancrush Awesome to see Theo Watson, Emily Gobeille and Mehmet Akten on the front page of NYT for their kinect hacks! http://nyti.ms/a7wNfU @sze Yes - next batch will be in January. Will announce dates here shortlyl ReBar is closed for an event, so it's superfine for the second night in a row. Bar fly. Oh, Twitter. You disappoint me. I'm off to give reBar in DUMBO another try. It's been great this week to add @h0use to the list of ridiculously talented and charming people I work with at the NYTimes. Anyone up for dinner in Brooklyn? Just realized I have no food at all here. Also, I'm still a shiny and fresh Brooklynite... Fun times at my first NYC processing workshop today. Thanks to everyone who attended. You guys were AWESOME! Emily & Theo have created a beautiful & engaging virtual puppeteering system with Kinect: http://bit.ly/bJlyFi - Bravo! Skillshare looks like an interesting initiative to promote small-scale teaching and learning: http://skillshare.com/ (via @sorayadarabi) Adding a new feature to the viz tool I'm working on at the NYTimes just spontaneously created another unexpected, amazing view of the data. @tensafefrogs I can't see how that could possibly go wrong. Interested in the basics of geo viz? Here's a nice post by @mezzoblue about GPS & Mercator projection: http://bit.ly/anvCT3 Snow on Saturday in Vancouver? Here I thought I was going to be in for a colder winter in NYC; it's a balmy 13° here! Nice article from the Columbia Journalism review - Steal This Heat Map! http://www.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/steal_this_heatmap.php @gjhead Good game by your Pens - but I'd like to see a match-up not at the end of a long road trip. (Excuses, excuses!) Fixed a small bug in the Text Comparison code and re-uploaded - the fix is also in the comments, thanks to @chris_swift Text Comparison Tool: SOURCE CODE - http://bit.ly/9sQ5WU @shiffman is the #Processing hero of the week with his #kinect library: http://www.shiffman.net/2010/11/14/kinect-and-processing/ (v @REAS) @brainpicker I've been staring at the MUJI book every day since it arrived in the store - it's just a matter of time. @gjhead @vlh That's my kind of bet! @gjhead I think you need someone on-call in Pittsburgh right now - since you're clearly delusional. Rauschenberg's tennis game performance at the 9 evenings event is still astounding, 44 years later: http://bit.ly/cQQkJQ The 9evenings: Theatre and Engineering site has some fascinating documentation about the famous 1966 art/sci/collabs: http://bit.ly/dCbQrm @brainpicker Nice earth images! Here's a hi-res version of the Garden City, Kansas one (my favourite): http://bit.ly/bP4rN6 I have an exciting evening of code releasing planned tonight. Text comparison tool. It WILL happen. @donohoe Come up to 28! We had our fire drill yesterday... How come it's always the day after you talk about not getting sick that you get sick? Curses. Wow - use Kinect to make any surface mult-touch. This seems very elegant. http://bit.ly/bV39iR (via @bruces) While we're at it, a bit more @TheNewPornos: http://bit.ly/9NnaDy http://bit.ly/9c7k9X Speaking of - who is going to the New Pornographers/Ted Leo show on December 6th at Terminal 5? New Pornographers fan? Must-watch: http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/episode/2848-matador-21/11 It's extraordinarily dangerous to have Vinegar Hill House 3 blocks from me. Had a truly extraordinary meal there tonight. Looks like the @TimesOpen event on Thursday is sold out. Mark Hansen and I will be showing some exciting things..!  http://bit.ly/d8I8Tk @mezzoblue Unfortunately, I just did. @mezzoblue Please, for the love of god, tell me you don't mean *actually* combine... @mezzoblue You're not getting all novelty beer on me, are you? Pizza beer, bacon beer... @mslima It was great to meet you on Friday - let's get together again soon! So. Very. Exciting. Excellent day in the R&D lab - making big progress and making discoveries with the visualization tool I'm building. Rushdie's newest book is a sequel of sorts to 1990's Haroun and the Sea of Stories, which is one of my favourites. Magical. I'll admit I'm excited to meet Salman Rushdie at his book signing @powerHouseArena this afternoon. http://bit.ly/9MT1p1 "Obviously designers do solve problems, but then so do dentists.

I'm loving the smart re-design of @mannytan's excellent http://uncontrol.com I solemnly promise to release my text comparison code this week. Likely on Wednesday. Really. @bit101 Yes - I love Okayodon and had read that before. Tasty, tasty children. I just posted a quick Processing tip about rendering large numbers of text objects: http://bit.ly/9sUeCj Fingerling potatoes, leeks, leftover duck, pumpkin ale - excellent. Roasted a duck last night. Now enjoying eggs fried in duck fat. Kind of a poultry mash-up. For the record, I have nothing against typewriters. Or hipsters. After all, I have both a typewriter and a beard. Hipsters buying typewriters. Spent 2 hours this afternoon watching very impressive ITP student projects on a very very impressive giant video wall. Thanks, @shiffman! Leave it to Mr. Bush to plagiarize his own memoirs. http://huff.to/btkhpK Either Twitter is dropping my follows, or I'm sleep-clicking at night. Had to re-follow the third person today I swore I was following b4... no reason to worry about the future of JAVA on the Mac OS-X platform: http://is.gd/gYhtc (via @ralfbernert) (via @jensfranke) "Even if they were assisted by the devil, that would probably be covered by the rules" - Kasparov on Advanced (or 'centaur') Chess Great time tonight with @pitchinteractiv. Science is Culture: Conversations at the New Intersection of Science & Society: http://salon.seedmagazine.com/ (via @adambly) "The robot that mimicked the cat’s tongue was built for an experiment on the International Space Station." Now that's a teaser. Tell me this research was funded by YouTube. http://nyti.ms/dj10Rv Big thanks to @heatherknight for giving a stellar talk at today's R&D speaker series event. Oh, and thanks also to @robotinthewild...! @pitchinteractiv You should have walked into the NYTimes building! Stories like this really make the news worth reading (and writing!): Dick Van Dyke rescued from porpoises: http://bit.ly/at6PX2 (v @NYCcyn) DUMBO-ites: Salman Rushdie will be at powerHouse Arena next Tuesday for a book signing! 1 - 1:30pm. I'm amazed at how much of today's media art is focused on computer vision projects. Perhaps this is a new field in the making: Vision Art? It's an excellent day today at NYTimes R&D. Projects getting done & @heatherknight will be in later to talk about human-robot interaction! @ThinkingDigital Small world! Google Refine - data cleaning and transformation tool http://bit.ly/bkda52  (@organised @JeffClark) A great way to start your day - Bill Nye's acceptance speech on being awarded Humanist of the Year: http://bit.ly/aIKw1J  (via @zimbalist) I just had an excellent random airport bar conversation with Clive Grinyer - http://www.clivegrinyer.com/ - MSP for the win, yet again. Is Ike's in MSP the best airport bar in America? Good food, Surly on tap - and the bartender just gave the woman beside me a birthday cake. Nice clean new site for my favourite NYC media design shop: http://localprojects.net/ The magnificent sunrise & crystalline terrain on the drive to YEG almost made up for a 3 hour wait at the airport. Going to be a LONG day. Twitter silence today is due to a glacially slow satellite internet connection. Will be back in business tomorrow. @ThinkingDigital I'd love to come back. All white dogs come from the moon. @JohnathonV Whatever you do, have the gnudi. @JohnathonV Did you make it to the Spotted Pig? This is the kind of day it is in Jarvie, Alberta: http://flic.kr/p/8RW3LS http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/ - Phew. Great to see the 4-minute highlight reel from last year's @ThinkingDigital. What a great event! http://bit.ly/2kjshZ The Large Hadron Collider creates generates a 'mini-Big Bang' - and it looks like a John Maeda piece: http://bbc.in/9b7T9e @mezzoblue That is not a good idea. Kudos to Robert Hodgin (@flight404 ) for releasing a 5-part flocking tutorial for Cinder: http://www.flight404.com/blog/?p=459 Mark Hansen and I will be presenting some of our R&D work at the Times Open Big Data event on November 18th: http://bit.ly/d97DeY @gersart I am in Jarvie - about 2 hours north of Edmonton. @JohnathonV Sounds like you had a great race - and nice to hear my fellow Brooklyners put on a good show! All three of my Processing workshops are now full - I'll be announcing January dates shortly. Minus nine celsius this morning in the Albertan wilderness. Clear & crisp. There is something simple and captivating about this piece by Elijah Porter: http://bit.ly/95L8mV Fantastic scientific imagery - 'Neuroscience, meet Conceptual Art': http://huff.to/cI8fCU @tararobertson Grated and sauteed; roasted; pureed in soup. Cool! My-Processing is an android app that renders Processing sketches over Webview using processing.js - http://bit.ly/blD7Ir @bit101 Look at Mr. Productive over there on the other side of the room, releasing software while I'm drinking whiskey. Having fun listening to @jkosoy tell us about the value of Whiskey while working. Important advice. @jennifergardy Oh come on - one beer at Gollem. You won't regret it. @jennifergardy Cool! One more recommend: http://cafegollem.nl/?page_id=14 Just got into Edmonton after a very long day of travel. Looking forward to FITC starting tomorrow! Leaving New York for Edmonton (at least for a few days). @adamtindale Awesome! I get in late tonight - but will definitely see you tomorrow. Nice work by Wes & the crew from @pitchinteractiv in this Wired story on NYC 311 calls: http://bit.ly/aKZyP3 (via @brainpicker) "7 hours later we had fired up some rocking Phish tracks from Microsoft’s Zune online service" - Wait. What?  http://nyti.ms/bmd3hr @amandabee The whole story is bizarre, to say the least... He would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for you meddling kids: http://bit.ly/dy9wl2 @theowatson Or maybe that's what it actually looks like there? @jennifergardy Go here tomorrow for lunch: http://www.gartine.nl/ I just had a wafel from Wafels & Dinges (@waffletruck). It changed my life. I think I can hear the cheers from BC all the way over here. Good riddance to a true scoundrel. @laurenbacon You missed the Vancouver workshops by a year! I don't think I'll be back there for a while..l @aesood I will be up to see Trapper, yes! But not in Calgary, this time around. Workshop update: Data Viz sold out, 2 spots left in Processing Level 1 & Level 2. http://blog.blprnt.com/workshops I'm excited to be heading out tomorrow evening to my birthplace - Edmonton- for @FITC. Oh, Alberta! http://bit.ly/bN9oC4 My Dec. 4th Processing & Data Visualization workshop is full. Processing Level 1 & 2 still have a couple of spaces left. @trippedout Yes - there will very likely be another set of workshops in January. Dataviz workshop on December 4th is half full after 30 minutes. Other two are getting there, too! http://blog.blprnt.com/workshops @mslima Drinks! Yes! I sent you an e-mail yesterday with my contact info... @bengl3rt No plans to release Just Landed. Drawing flight paths btw lat/lon points is not hard. Look into mercator projections, use arc(). Processing Workshops in NYC! Fun! Learning! Beer! Spectacular views! http://bit.ly/deTXd1 Pass it on! Quick poll question: If you were to take a one-day workshop on a weekend, would you rather do it on a Saturday or a Sunday? @brainpicker Hey! I haven't bought anything from MUJI for four days! @heatherknight Have you started a CMU Bombardment Society? or a Trap and Skeet Club? It's National Sandwich Day in the USA today. That last link came courtesy of @pitchinteractiv. Infographic showing the shift in voter activity between elections - small towns and seniors were the story yesterday: http://nyti.ms/a7Gm8W @richtextformat I didn't source-check the article, but it seems the new testimony is pretty clear. During the 1960s, abstract expressionism was a 'key weapon' for the CIA: http://ind.pn/aAP8uU (via @golan) And by @deconcept I clearly meant @tensafefrogs. Easy mistake. Watching @deconcept repeatedly refresh his twitter search at #toreal. Oh, the irony. I really like saying 'PubSubHubbub'. You probably do, too. Try it. Are you going to the @timesopen real-time web event? I am. http://bit.ly/9LAuyp Latest numbers on the growth of the Processing project: http://j.mp/9P6vks (via @ben_fry) Hey @mslima - welcome to NYC! Heading down to @betaworks to sneak-peak some of the exciting things we've been working on at the NYTimes R&D lab. I feel guilty for not voting today, even though I can't. Pan-roasted chicken, wild mushrooms & leeks, with a classic risotto - it's nice to have a real kitchen again. I'm digging Dan Mangan (@danmanganmusic) today. Clever and folky, in a good sort of way. @evands http://trac.adium.im/ticket/14469 @evands Will do when I get the chance. Just downloaded and installed @Adium 1.4. Unfortunately it crashes 10 seconds into launch. Quel pain in the ass. http://fitc.ca/edmonton starts saturday! Hear from @wheniwas19 @keithpeters @mesh @waxpraxis @jted @kosoy @gskinner and more (via @FITC) If this is November in NYC, I am A-OK with it. Operation Ignore New Years Eve Because I'm Sick is now in full effect - signing off of Twitter. See you in 2011, my friends. @robinsloan Bookends? In case you missed it yesterday, I made a gratuitously animated visualization for @brainpicker of her top 10 stories: http://bit.ly/ecjxp5 And to go with that, a classig SIGGRAPH paper from 2010 on using L-Systems to model cities: http://bit.ly/h30S5W A favourite from 2010: Voxel City - generative urban landscapes built using cellular automata: http://bit.ly/hgYgiG There are some gems in this list of notable NYTimes opinion art from 2011: http://nyti.ms/fkIjoT Revised NYE plans involve sneezing, coughing, and quarantine. Perhaps with a nip of Nyquil to ring in 2011. I am sick as the proverbial dog. Wait... what proverb is the dog in? Golan Levin's classic, transfixing interactive piece Yellowtail is now available as an iPhone app: http://bit.ly/hvhELf I will be speaking with Miguel Cardoso (Bestiario), Manuel Lima (viusalcomplexity) and Henry Markram (Blue Brain Project) I'm very excited to be speaking in Lisbon on February 18th in the Image in Science and Art colloquium: http://bit.ly/ec9IQb @blellum Hey - haven't looked at it in a while. Send me an e-mail? Trying out Echofon, on recommendation from @EjG3 and @flowingdata. Any suggestions for a good Mac (non-Air) Twitter client? Since Tweetie seems to have given up on updates? I wholeheartedly agree with John Maeda (@johnmaeda) on the value of art to innovation: http://bit.ly/hqQ9Ql (via @seedmag) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Plague_of_1518 (via @aarontweets) And if that isn't enough, how about some inexpensive choices? http://nyti.ms/dNdiqf The fact that I've been to zero of Sam Sifton's favourite new restaurants of 2010 makes an easy resolution for 2011: http://nyti.ms/hrBbbt Earth to @brainpicker - come in, @brainpicker... @serial_consign I actually AM laughing. I've essentially stopped taking anything discussed on the 'public' internet seriously. I've learned to laugh at things like this reddit thread - where my work gets soundly trashed for 73 comments. http://bit.ly/hQ6fLH I like the word 'flowprint' to describe this animated map of London's bus traffic: http://urbagram.net/flowprint/ One hour on the tarmac. One hour in the cab line. Good times. Yahoo! Standby success! Looks like about midnight for an arrival... #thankmyluckystars Missed my flight due to immigration, not snow. On standby, but next flight is on Thursday.2 Leaving Jarvie, Alberta. Any guesses when I'll get back home in Brooklyn? Closest guess gets a prize... Last night in Northern Alberta. Will try, by hook or by crook, to get back to NYC tomorrow. Wish me luck? Gorgeous photo from NASA showing the East Coast storm front: http://bit.ly/h0IeXl @heatherknight Number 5? You was robbed! @stefras I've been two hours north of Edmonton for the last 6 days - no shortage of snow...! @scottjanousek @bit101 I have been very very happy with @webfaction since I made the switch last year. Strangely this visualization I'm working on has turned out snow-themed. Re-wrote and performed the Spiderman musical, with my 6yr-old niece and my 4yr-old nephew. No injuries. Ms. Taymor - you have my number. Heavy snow warning for NYC. Please please please be clear by Tuesday night. Please. Two geese, stuffing, gravy, brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes, homemade dinner rolls and champagne. #sothisischristmas @tensafefrogs I'm not even going to ask. Ralph Nader (yes, Ralph Nader) on Wikileaks: http://bit.ly/gFPb2o (via @zimbalist) @zimbalist Ralph Nader is a good warm-up! True Alberta Christmas dinner - goose bought from the Hutterite colony. @dasRupa I will admit, with a bit of shame, that I thought the exact same thing. With the 'torn' condom and all - maybe Assange is a Drummer? #thediamondage We've had Jaron Lanier and Bruce Sterling. All I want for x-mas is a Neal Stephenson essay about Wikileaks. Are you listening, Santa? I don't agree with Bruce Sterling, or with Jaron Lanier - though both have offered interesting takes on Wikileaks. Bruce Sterling on Wikileaks: http://www.webstock.org.nz/blog/2010/the-blast-shack/ @REAS Me, too! Missed the @bruces essay, though- link? @sgentiluomo I am in Canada! Back on the 28th, though - so, shortly after that? For those looking for a complete set of NYTimes R&D follows, how about @chris_ackermann, our director of emerging platforms? Zeynep Tufecki's critique of Jaron Lanier's problematic WIkileaks essay is spot-on: http://bit.ly/gjVmtT In case you're wondering, that last tweet was a clever ploy to get @jakeporway active on twitter. Did you know the NYTimes has a Data Scientist? It's true. And you can follow him - @jakeporway Beginning my epic journey to the Canadian hinterland. Should be in Jarvie, Albera in 15 hours. Trying to use frame.setUndecorated() in Processing with OS 10.6 with no avail. Any ideas? I was getting caught up in the X-mas gift buying frenzy, then read this article by Nick Kristof on humanitarian gifts: http://nyti.ms/hTUIcP @alexismadrigal I can understand the logic - it just seems like an unusual request. I'll be interested to see how you curate the responses. Interesting that Jaron Lanier requested that comments be disabled on his piece for The Atlantic. Is this a common request by op-ed authors? @harrisj Just going to get a bite and a beer at reBar beforehand - join me if you'd like. @harrisj Hey - I'll be there too! Bravo - @ACNewman and the New Pornographers perform an acoustic version of Adventures in Solitude for It Gets Better: http://bit.ly/h4UlOo @suneman Strange serendipity - @zimbalist and I were just talking about this article! http://nyr.kr/f7gBMK Fantastic article by Elizabeth Pisani on big data and the end of the scientific method http://is.gd/j4iZO (via @brainpicker) WikiLeaks will turn us into North Korea. Wait... what? This essay from Jaron Lanier is an interesting mess: http://bit.ly/eLW9kZ @erdogan I was there yesterday - can't handle two days in a row!

'Tis the season to say thank-you for open source! @toxiclibs @ben_fry @reas @codeanticode @shiffman @pheinberg #OSThanks @BCbrews - @Barley_Mowat should be on that list! @TEDchris Christmas shopping makes me think of Michael Landy's Break Down - in which he destroyed everything he owned: http://bit.ly/i4ajoY I'm really excited to be doing some screenprinting with @mariuswatz next month.

A gin and tonic will have to do. I finished Joseph O'Neill's Netherland on the subway this morning. A book that will haunt me for a long time to come (in a good way). The Vancouver Aquarium did this a decade or more ago, but it's still cool: Electric eel-powered x-mas tree  http://bit.ly/f35CWg Today has been an excellent nerd day. Working on 15' of displays, making iPhone controls, now rendering movies for a 3D TV. Yay, Processing! @joshgiesbrecht Definitely there are people working with quasi-random data sets. But i don't know about 'fictional'... ScraperWiki's API makes it very very easy to plug & play with Processing - http://scraperwiki.com/api/1.0 @mathpunk The ScraperWiki API looks really handy. Very impressive! .@blprnt I made this! http://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/open-food-data/ (via @mathpunk) ScraperWiki looks great - a collection of data scrapers for getting information out of webpages: http://scraperwiki.com/ (via @mathpunk) I'm speaking with a great group of brainy creators (Jared Tarbell, Robert Hodgin, Paula Scher) in NYC at http://www.geekybynature.com/ No software tricks - just two Matrox TripleHead2Go boxes. Limitation right now is in the max GL texture size. Running a 6400*720 Processing sketch across 5 monitors, run by one machine. It's gorgeous. @TruthSeerum Still in the works. Should have some public stuff to show early January. Nice (and informative!) interview with @nervous_jessica & @nervous_jesse on @creatorsproject - http://bit.ly/gFJsVE These actions by the US government lead me to believe that there is much more damaging info in the yet-to-be-released Wikileaks cables.

I just think the discussion should consider the benefits of personal engagement between student and teacher. @axiomsofchoice I just think the distilled lesson from his talk that is being passed around (the homework/lecture reversal) is problematic. @axiomsofchoice I'm not saying that Kahn's lectures are flawed. Not at all. @IbrokenJames In my personal experience it isn't that cut and dry. Even when giving a 'preset' lecture, things tend to be dynamic. That's an amazing picture of Probert on the front page of NYTimes.com. RT @FeMaven @blprnt I think it commoditizes education. - I completely agree.

I promptly forgot all of the answers which is why I'm recording these. @deepfoo The list is for big books - Alice Munro is great, but short stories. Lorrie Moore, too... @deepfoo Blind Assassin and Robber Bride both make the cut (500p+). @deepfoo I'm just calling 'em as I see 'em! @arnicas That's the one that's on the list! And yes, I have. 26 books on the list, 1 female author. Are big books all written by men? @datatelling I suspect we have the exact same bookshelf. @jschwabish I read very, very little non-fiction. @Raincityvic There for 3 days starting tomorrow.

Twice. :) @datatelling Have read 2666, but will put it on the list... @hungar I've already read it - it's just on the list for posterity's sake, since many people suggested it. @hungar I've read them all! Some, twice. (My arbitrary 'big book' cutoff is 500 pages.) Lots of big book suggestions! I'm posting the full list here: https://t.co/qWqw3FLP @faunts A *long* time ago, yes. Could be worth a second run. @peacockc I'm Canadian! Of course I've read them already… ;) @spikespike I have Pale King, and it's a candidate. Somehow reticent to read an unfinished book.
