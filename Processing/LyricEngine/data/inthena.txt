Lose my step
Wash my back
Hypnotized
Hold me close
Incomplete
Could I be less?
Hold my hand 
Watch my back

[Then I wouldn’t need a single NA, to take each NA as my own. No I wouldn’t need a single thing, higher then anyone, I’d be staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.]

Animal
Holy Ghost
I take control
Don’t hold me back
Chemical
Won’t be late
[In the NA will be my fate]

[Then I wouldn’t feel the need to NA, if I was tired and used to all, no I wouldn’t have a single thought, free from any MA or BA, staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.]

State my name
Will not complain
In the name
Hold me close
Want my day
Take all the blame
We’ll marry one day
And close the gate

[Then I wouldn’t be the only one, to delve into the sea of NA, no I wouldn’t have a single thought, free from any MA or BA, I’d be staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.]
