get my voice
Wash my back
photographed
Let me see
terrific
Could I be less?
and my knees
Watch my back

[Then I wouldn’t need a single NA, to take each NA as my own. No I wouldn’t need a single thing, higher then anyone, I’d be staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.]

horrible
do David
Dont Throw Bouquets
Don’t hold me back
Indistinct
Won’t be late
[In the NA will be my fate]

[Then I wouldn’t feel the need to NA, if I was tired and used to all, no I wouldn’t have a single thought, free from any MA or BA, staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.]

State my name
Will not complain
in the house
make me do
think my days
Take all the blame
We’ll marry one day
and throw the stuff

[Then I wouldn’t be the only one, to delve into the sea of NA, no I wouldn’t have a single thought, free from any MA or BA, I’d be staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.]
