When word broke out they tumbled like an avalanche It was the year that saw all seasons compounded As they pray out loud that their eyes may be gouged out So that the blue turns red and our senses are the only ones Can anybody beg me to swallow the big blue?
Wasting my time ain’t too much bother I’ll be like a dog You’ve been wasting your time with your crystal ball I’ll be with my guitar Will be the end to all your trouble I declare the law But do I belong?
Who’s going to love you when you are old?
Will I be lewd to the dude and crude to his prude and to his profession?
Who in the world would be here if he wasn’t a whore?
Who gives your orders?
