No I wouldnt need a single thing higher then anyone Id be staring at the ground with my head in the clouds
A little bit of amity a little bit of lust Ill suck the venom from your skin but you wont let me in A little bit of spittle and a little bit of blood The little bit from each we mix it may be taking on But the little bit that doesnt is the bit I need the most Why am I the only one to do anything about it
We dont want no gay goth scene in this house and we dont want no gorgeous teen in your mouth and we dont like your gay goth zines its teenage hell and we dont like your gay goth scene That boy takes away your selfesteem
