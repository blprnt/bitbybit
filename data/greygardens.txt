 

[ Mrs. Beale ]

What are you doing down there ?

Just standing there ?



 

                   

- [ David Maysles ]

Just filming the main room.

- [ Edie ] Whiskers!



 

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ]

Well; did you know that

Whiskers has disappeared?



 

                   

-A cat got out.

I'm trying to get him in.

-[ David ] Has he ? Ah.



 

                   

Yeah, we don't know how he got out.

I think he got out in that hole there.



 

                   

- No; I knew they were coming; and I--

- I think he got out in that hole.



 

                   

- He can jump up there.

- I knew they were coming and--



 

                   

Yeah. No, he got out

in that hole, Edie.



 

                   

I put them all out.

You told me to.



  

                   

No, dearie, he got out

in the hole, babe.



  

                   

''Take the cats out; ''you said.



  

                   

- Did you hear what I said, woman ?

- What ?



  

                   

He got out in this hole here.

That was the noise we heard.



  

                   

That raccoon did that to my new wall.

Isn't that terrible ?



  

                   

They'll have the whole house

down soon.



  

                   

[ Edie ]

Yeah; we'll be raided again.



  

                   

We'll be raided again

by the village of East Hampton.



  

                   

You know; they can get you

in East Hampton for wearing

red shoes on a Thursday...



  

                   

and all that sort of thing.



  

                   

I don't know whether you know that.

I mean; do you know that ?



  

                   

They can get you

for almost anything.



  

                   

-[ Edie ] It's the Maysles!

-[ Albert Maysles ] Hi; Edie.



  

                   

-[ David ] The gentlemen callers.

- I saw your car.



  

                   

- One of my cats just got out.

- Edie;you look fantastic.



  

                   

David, you look absolutely

terrific. Honestly.



  

                   

You've got light--

You've got light blue on.



  

                   

Well, Al, you're still--

Mother says you're very conservative.



  

                   

[ Laughs ]

Brooks, everything looks wonderful.



  

                   

- Thank you.

- Absolutely wonderful.



  

                   

This is the best thing

to wear for the day. You understand.



  

                   

- Yeah.

- Because I don't like women in skirts,



  

                   

and the best thing is to wear

pantyhose or some pants...



  

                   

under a short skirt, I think.



  

                   

Then you have the pants

under the skirt,



  

                   

and then you can pull the stockings

up over the pants, underneath the skirt.



  

                   

- Uh-huh.

- And you can always take off

the skirt and use it as a cape.



  

                   

So I think this is the best

costume for the day.



  

                   

- Okay.

- [ Laughs ]



  

                   

I have to think

these things up, you know.



  

                   

Mother wanted me to come out

in a kimono, so we had quite a fight.



  

                   

So what did you do, photograph Brooks

cutting right down here ?



  

                   

- Yeah; I've been through the jungle.

- Oh, for goodness sakes.



  

                   

What do you want to do now ?

Where do you want to go ? Upstairs ?



  

                   

Do you want to go up

and photograph it from the top porch ?



  

                   

- Okay.

- Okay.



  

                   

They're gonna photograph

from the top now, Brooks.



  

                   

[ David ]

It's a beautiful garden back here.



  

                   

Did you see the wall garden ?



  

                   

- Oh, you mean the patio.

You mean this.

- Yeah.



  

                   

That's a Spanish wall garden

over there;you know.



  

                   

- Oh;yes.

- The Hills put that in.



  

                   

They imported

everything from Rome.



  

                   

Mrs. Hill, she was

a famous horticulturist.



  

                   

That was one of the famous

gardens of America.



  

                   

Brooks; next summer;

if we're all living;



  

                   

I think a vegetable garden

would be a good thing in here.



  

                   

You don't get

enough sunlight in here.



  

                   

Yeah; Mother says she doesn't mind

if you have to cut down some privet

for the garden.



  

                   

- Would be nice.

- Yeah.



  

                   

Because food's going up.

We heard that on the radio last night.



  

                   

Do you think my costume

looked all right for Brooks ?

I think he was a little amazed.



  

                   

- He's probably seen it before.

- No, no. This is

the revolutionary costume.



  

                   

I never wear this in East Hampton.



  

                   

[ David ] He seems okay.

He seems like he can handle it.



  

                   

[ Edie ]

You can't be too careful.

Know what I mean ?



  

                   

That was

the original living room.



  

                   

You know, people go back

to a kitchen now.



  

                   

Though the washing machine was always

put in the maids' dining room.



  

                   

You know, the washtubs are

in the maids' dining room.



  

                   

- Let's go up.

- It's very difficult...



  

                   

to keep the line between

the past and the present.



  

                   

Do you know what I mean ?

It's awfully difficult.



  

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ] That is

a beautiful ocean today; isn't it ?



  

                   

What color would you say

that was ? Sort of sapphire ?



  

                   

I've never seen

anything like that ocean.



  

                   

The    years I've been here--



  

                   

the best in    years.



  

                   

Oh; Edie; are you around?



  

                   

- Oh; Edie!

- I haven't been out of this

goddamn horrible place...



  

                   

in two years.



  

                   

God, if you knew how I felt.

I'm ready to kill.



  

                   

Well; they're not going

to take you to the beach.



  

                   

- Brooks wants his...

his check, Mother darling.

-All right; give me the--



  

                   

- He's at the door.

- I told you I should do it now.



  

                   

Twenty-four bucks for three cuttings.

Just a minute.



  

                   

I told you--

Better bring the pen.



  

                   

I locked all the cats away.



  

                   

-[ Cats Meowing ]

- Don't be so mean.

They don't wanna be locked away.



  

                   

The poor little kitties.

You know kitties adore sun.



  

                   

I suppose I won't get out

of here till she dies or I die.



  

                   

- Who's she ? The cat ?

- I don't know when

I'm gonna get out of here.



  

                   

- Why do you want to get out ?

Another place'd be much worse.

- 'Cause I don't like it.



  

                   

- Any place will be much worse.

- Here.



  

                   

- Any place on earth.

- Yeah, but I like freedom.



  

                   

Well, you can't get it, darling.

You're being supported.



  

                   

- You can't get any freedom

when you're being supported.

- Yeah; but--



  

                   

- You can't ?

- No;you can't.



  

                   

- I think you're not free when

you're not being supported.

- You have to toe the mark.



  

                   

- It's awful both ways.

- Well;you don't look it.



   

                   

You look very young

for    years of age.



   

                   

Don't you remember

what you told me--



   

                   

- I'd just like a couple of days

on the beach, that's all.

- What was it you told me ?



   

                   

- Twenty-four bucks.

- You don't have to scream that out.



   

                   

When are you gonna learn, Edie ?

You're in this world, you know.



   

                   

You're not out of the world.



   

                   

[ Edie Sighs ]



   

                   

Let's see if I can remember the date.

Is it the    th today ?



   

                   

- Well; there are certain

compensations; I guess.

- Is it the    th today ?



   

                   

The old woman, she has to remember

everything, you know that.



   

                   

I think this is correct.



   

                   

Brooks Hiers. H-I-E-R-S.



   

                   

- Oh; I didn't think it was necessary.

- Yes.



   

                   

Why didn't you let me

do this in the house for ?

Why did you make me do it here ?



   

                   

Mother;you don't have

enough clothes on.



   

                   

Well, I hope-- I'm gonna get naked in

just a minute, so you better watch out.



   

                   

- That's what I'm afraid of.

- Yeah; for what ? Now; why?



   

                   

- I haven't got any warts on me.

- But the movie, the movie.



   

                   

- I haven't got any warts on me.

- That isn't the point, Mother darling.



   

                   

Well;you know where you got;

being like that.



   

                   

No husband; no babies; nothing.



   

                   

I can't help it.

I like to wear certain things.



   

                   

- Is that H-Y-E-R ? H-Y?

- She likes everything without girdles.



   

                   

- H-Y; Edie; or H-I ?

- H-Y-E-R-S.



   

                   

- H-Y ?

- Yeah.



   

                   

She and Marjorie don't believe

in wearing girdles.



   

                   

I haven't worn a girdle

since I was     years old.



   

                   

- Here you are.

- Mother has certain ideas about, uh--



   

                   

- I certainly have certain ideas

about living a long time.

-About clothes.



   

                   

- That's what I got ideas about.

-[ Door Closes ]



   

                   

It's very hard to live nowadays.

Living is very difficult.



   

                   

''The Libra husband

is not an easy man to please.



   

                   

''The monotony of domesticity

is not to his liking,



   

                   

but he is a passionate man

and a respecter of tradition.''



   

                   

All I have to do

is find this Libra man.

That's all I need-- order.



   

                   

That's all I need--

You know, a manager.



   

                   

But he's got to be a Libran.



   

                   

[ Man ]

Hello.



   

                   

Yeah ?



   

                   

- That sounds likeJerry.

- Oh, is thatJerry ?

For goodness sakes.



   

                   

-[ Edie Laughing ]

- What are you doing ?



   

                   

Jerry, you're

Aquarius, aren't you ?



   

                   

That's what I saw

when I met you;Jerry.



   

                   

- Remember I said the Marble Faun;

and it was terrible.

- Yeah.



   

                   

Terrible, the tragedy

connected with the Marble Faun.



   

                   

- You know, I callJerry

''the Marble Faun.''

- Nathaniel Hawthorne.



   

                   

- Yeah.

- Yeah.



   

                   

Do you have

that book here, Edie ?



   

                   

I haven't been able

to find it.



   

                   

If you run across it,

I'd like to read it.



   

                   

It's very deep. I don't know whether

you-- Well; I guess you're up to it.



   

                   

They used to have it

on all the, uh--



   

                   

I think it was on the high school

reading list. The Marble Faun.



   

                   

''The Libra husband

does not seek divorce...



   

                   

''unless the conditions of his life...



   

                   

are not adjustable.''



   

                   

I don't believe in divorce at all.



   

                   

- I think divorce--

- Was your mother divorced or no ?



   

                   

- No.

-Separated.



   

                   

Yes, and then my father got a,

got a fake Mexican divorce,



   

                   

and he... did have, you know,

what he called another wife.



   

                   

But we didn't recognize it. It wasn't

recognized by the Catholic Church.



   

                   

They don't recognize it,

you know.



   

                   

Say, are you bossing me around, Edie ?

All afternoon ?



   

                   

-[ Edie ] I think that's terrific.

- Oh, Edie, it's not the best one.



   

                   

This is the worst one

of my wedding pictures.



   

                   

The others look worse.



   

                   

I was gonna be a singer;you know.

Aprofessional singer.



   

                   

When I met Mr. Beale;

the jig was up.



   

                   

Do you remember this ?

- The villain of the piece.

-So we did love each other.

- Did I laugh when I read that.



   

                   

Aren't kids terrible ?

I just roared.



   

                   

When the people don't speak;

they never get divorced.



   

                   

- You just can't tell.

- I've been a very happy woman

all my life.



   

                   

Shall I tell them about Gould?



   

                   

Gould was Mother's accompanist.



   

                   

He was a boogie-woogie composer

who had the most terrific style.



   

                   

He was the most brilliant man

I've ever met.



   

                   

That's including Mr. Beale

and Mr. Bouvier.



   

                   

Completely brilliant.



   

                   

This is cute, Mother.



   

                   

I like that very much.

Don't you, David ?



   

                   

You said Michelle Beale

stole this, didn't you, Edie ?



   

                   

I never did.

She'd never do that.



   

                   

See how fat I was, Edie ?



   

                   

Did I look like a good mother ?



   

                   

Was I a good mother ?



   

                   

-[ David ] It looks like it.

- What ? Looks like it.



   

                   

I didn't starve my children,

did I ? What ?



   

                   

Fed 'em. Fed 'em well.



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ]

They were very nice children.

I enjoyed them tremendously.



   

                   

I'm crazy about my two sons;

absolutely mad about them.



   

                   

-[ David ] Who's the little girl?

-[ Edie ] That's me.



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ] Well; the boys were;

were not hard to handle at all.



   

                   

- They were very easy to handle.

- Oh; my mother never saw my brothers.



   

                   

I saw them every minute;

every single minute.



   

                   

- Oh; they never got

any discipline; my brothers.

- They didn't need it.



   

                   

- They were absolutely perfect.

- They never got any discipline.



   

                   

This was taken with a tiny

little Kodak Number Two.



   

                   

That was. Kodak Number Two.

Cost two dollars, that camera.



   

                   

- Mother, I'm mad

about these pictures of you.

- Oh; no; don't take those.



   

                   

- We'll just put them right over here.

- Oh; no; I want those out.



   

                   

- Will you give me those; please ?

- No, you can't have them.



   

                   

I want them; Edie.

I will never see them again.

Now; I want those pictures.



   

                   

- I want those pictures; Edie.

- You can't expose them

to the light in here.



   

                   

No; give me those pictures.

I don't want to ask    times.



   

                   

- Come on.

- I want to show that to Al.



   

                   

- No, I want--

- I wanna show it to Al !



   

                   

- It's my picture.

- Look what you made me do.



   

                   

Well, you did it.

Look what she did.



   

                   

- Mrs. Beale had a classical face.

I want you to see this.

- Look at what she did.



   

                   

- Look. Very few people have this.

- Don't touch that !



   

                   

Al, I want you to see this.



   

                   

-[ Edith Laughing ]

- Now look, this is my mother.



   

                   

This British blood;

maybeJewish; I don't know.



   

                   

In the Leaman family;

I'm not sure.



   

                   

- I don't want that photographed.

- Scotch blood-- the Ewings.



   

                   

- Imagine showing those horrible things

I don't want you to show.

- The Ewing clan's in there.



   

                   

But it's just a girl

from a good French family.



   

                   

It's a very beautiful face.



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ]

I lived alone at least    years.

I-I didn't mind.



   

                   

You get very independent

when you live alone.



   

                   

You get to be a real individual.



   

                   

- You can't have your cake

and eat it too in life.

- Oh;yes; I did.



   

                   

I did. I had my cake; loved it;

masticated it; chewed it...



   

                   

- and had everything I wanted.

- You can't have your cake

and eat it too.



   

                   

I had a very, very happy,

satisfying life.



   

                   

Well;you had a rich husband

You should have stayed with him.



   

                   

- Now you might as well face it.

- What! For money?



   

                   

- She was bored.

- Why; I was not. I was a great singer.



   

                   

I had a perfect marriage;

beautiful children.



   

                   

Terribly successful marriage.

Never had a fight in my life.



   

                   

- I never threw anything

at Mr. Beale. Never.

- [ Laughing ]



   

                   

They threw the bull around,

as they say.



   

                   

No, I never had any words

with Mr. Beale at all.



   

                   

I came down here to live in this,

in this house because I did

all my singing here.



   

                   

I was so happy. I was happier

going out and singing...



   

                   

than anything I've ever done

since I was born.



   

                   

I liked it better

than anything I ever did.



   

                   

- I can't find it, Mother.

- Well;you could let me help you.



   

                   

- Let me--

- Listen, kid.

I'm extremely organized.



   

                   

I know exactly where

to look for this stuff.



   

                   

I've got it under control

right here, but I can't find it.



   

                   

Get it ?



   

                   

Well; bring in the--

bring in the orchestration...

I can't do it.

My feet hurt.



   

                   

Just try; babe.

They're beautiful.



   

                   

I have to get my voice exactly back

the way it was when I was    years old.



   

                   

- You can't; Mother darling.

- Oh, yes, I can. Oh, yes !



   

                   

-Something happens; face it.

- I never strained my voice

ever in my life.



   

                   

- Oh; but I strain my voice

from yelling and screaming.

- I've never smoked cigarettes.



   

                   

- What is the matter with me ?

I could never speak again.

- Oh, no.



   

                   

Why; I can get it back

in about a month;just about.

You know; good hard work.

-Sing it; babe. Just sing it.

- He was Mother's accompanist.



   

                   

We belong together

- Oh, my heart, what happened ?



   

                   

- That's pretty, that note.

- Terrific.



   

                   

Oh, that's terrible.



   

                   

Oh; I see. It repeats.



   

                   

Yes, that's very important,

- ''Could I Be in Love. ''



   

                   

Do you want that ?

Aren't you mad about your record ?



   

                   

I was very serious

about my singing. Loved it.



   

                   

After you hear that;

you realize nothing is--



   

                   

- Important.

- No; it isn't. Nothing.



   

                   

Well; my mother;you know; she gave me

the right slant on my voice.



   

                   

She told me to leave everything;

to leave everything.



   

                   

No man could compete

against Mrs. Beale and Gould.



   

                   

- We were pretty good.

- No man in the world.



   

                   

Well; I worked hard.

I wish you would play ''Laura. ''



   

                   

Imagine bothering about anything

when she had a talent like that ?



   

                   

Well, I had to take care of this house.

I lived on no money.



   

                   

You were able to save

the house on account of me.



   

                   

- Yeah, I think that--

- I didn't want to live in East Hampton;



   

                   

but I had to on account

of Mother's house.



   

                   

Well, now you see why you lived,

because you had music all the time.



   

                   

That's why.

And you went to the beach too.



   

                   

- That's what you liked.

- Those are the only things.



   

                   

Well, I think

you liked your dancing.



   

                   

- You were very good at that.

He did.



   

                   

Will he or will not

handle himself...



   

                   

in the years that are to come ?



   

                   

He wasn't emotional.



   

                   

He didn't get upset.



   

                   

- He wasn't nervous.

- He wasn't me.



   

                   

He was cool.

Now one thing is sure.:



   

                   

The human mind will not function

when it is hot.



   

                   

- Only when it is cool

and dispassionate...

- Dispassionate.



   

                   

- That was the word

I wanted to other day.

- will it produce.



   

                   

I couldn't think

of what it was.



   

                   

I think it would be a good idea

if every day every individual...



   

                   

would look at himself

in the mirror;



   

                   

earnestly;

and ask the question;



   

                   

''Who am I ?

Am I a weak person ?



   

                   

Am I a defeated person ?

Am I an inferior person ?''



   

                   

Not at all.



   

                   

I am a child of God;



   

                   

and I was intended

to get on top of things...



   

                   

and I was intended to stay there.



   

                   

-Amen; amen

- Very good. That was very long.



   

                   

- Very long.

- You notice how he went

on and on and on ?



   

                   

Let's hear the prayer.

I mean the song. You sing the song now.



   

                   

- Doxology.

- Sing it.



   

                   

[ Announcer ] You have been listening

to Dr. Norman Vincent Peale...



   

                   

-as he spoke this morning

from his pulpit...

- No emotionalism.



   

                   

-at Marble Collegiate Church.

- Never give up.

You want to keep on top.



   

                   

Way up high up on top.



   

                   

Wonderful way

to smother somebody.



   

                   

[ Laughing ] Would you pass

your mirror over here ?



   

                   

I've got to see what I look like.



   

                   

- [ Laughing ]

- Don't drop it.



   

                   

- Uptight.

- That was wonderful.



   

                   

I see why I've got cataracts.



   

                   

I have astigmatism,

one eye pulled against the other,



   

                   

and I should've worn glasses

and I didn't.



   

                   

- Oh; I told you to wear glasses.

- Is there anything else

you want to know ?



   

                   

- You got with the glasses

about four years ago.

- I'll tell you about my teeth.



   

                   

Four years ago; Edie. You got

the glasses; and you didn't wear them.



   

                   

- My teeth are still all right.

- You have to wear the glasses

when; when you have any trouble.



   

                   

You have to.



   

                   

[ Laughs ]



   

                   

And my hair will grow...

I hope. Here.



   

                   

[ David ]

You're dressed for battle; Edie.



   

                   

Mother's telling Marjorie how

spoiled I am, how terrible I am.



   

                   

And Marjorie knew my father

and my uncle and everybody.



   

                   

Mother's giving her

all this S-H-I-T,



   

                   

so I went and told her

some things about the family.



   

                   

But, you see,

in dealing with me...



   

                   

the relatives didn't know...



   

                   

that they were dealing

with a staunch character.



   

                   

And I tell you, if there's anything

worse than a staunch woman--



   

                   

S-T-A-U-N-C-H.



   

                   

There's nothing worse,

I'm telling you.



   

                   

[ Sighs ]



   

                   

They don't weaken... no matter what.



   

                   

But they didn't know that.

Well, how were they to know ?



   

                   

You know, my father had made up his mind

about what Farmington produced...



   

                   

and what the

Sacred Heart Convent produced.



   

                   

I don't think he was so down

on the Spence School,



   

                   

but he certainly was down

on Farmington.



   

                   

I don't know why.

Farmington was a junior college.



   

                   

You could choose

what you wanted to study.



   

                   

Perhaps that was what made

my father dislike it so--



   

                   

that I could choose.



   

                   

But I chose what I thought

he'd want me to choose--



   

                   

you know,

English literature and...



   

                   

Oriental philosophies and, uh...



   

                   

well, I always took French,

but nothing ever happened there.



   

                   

I can read and write in French,

but I can't speak it.



   

                   

I had years and years

and years of French.



   

                   

Terrible.

[ Laughs ]



   

                   

This was taken by Amy Dupont

my last year in Farmington.



   

                   

I was    .



   

                   

-[ David ] Edie; that's so beautiful.

- Mr. Wainwright did that.



   

                   

He was an artist from a very good

family. He was in the social register.



   

                   

He did it in the solarium

of Grey Gardens.



   

                   

David; look at this.

I was in a fashion show.



   

                   

-[ Laughs ]

-[ Mrs. Beale ] Let me see that.



   

                   

[ Albert ]

Oh; beautiful. Look at that; David.



   

                   

-[ Mrs. Beale ] May I see that ?

- Wow! Look at that.



   

                   

[ Edie ] I thought I was

the cat's pajamas in that!



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ] You did; Edie. See how

pretty Edie was when she was young ?



   

                   

It's perfectly foolish of her

not to look that way now.



   

                   

She could;you know; if she

didn't worry about everything.



   

                   

Didn't she look like a girl

that had everything ? Huh ?



   

                   

[ Edie ]

This has inspired me.



   

                   

I'll have to get another

brown tailored suit and grow my hair.



   

                   

My God; I have no hair.



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ] You never put any

lipstick on for this picture; did you ?



   

                   

- I have another kind on.

- You look horrible.



   

                   

Why didn't you put

lipstick and makeup on ?



   

                   

[ Edie ] Mr. Beale smashed

the window of Burt Bacharach...



   

                   

when he put this in the window

on upper Madison Avenue.



   

                   

-[ Mrs. Beale ] For God's sakes.

- He offered me a job.



   

                   

He didn't say to get out

of that family situation;



   

                   

but he said;

''You need a job; Miss Beale. ''



   

                   

[ David ] Didn't you expect that Edie

might get married someday?



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ]

Oh; I did. I wanted her to.



   

                   

Oh; I picked out some nice men.

She didn't like the men I picked out.



   

                   

[ Edie ]

They were horrible.



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ] She could have married

this Gerald Getty.



   

                   

He was a millionaire;:

he gave her a gorgeous ring.



   

                   

She decided not to marry that guy.

She had to give the ring back.



   

                   

She has a proposal of marriage

from Paul Getty.



   

                   

Remember Paul;

the richest man in the world?



   

                   

[ Edie ]

He married Teddy Lynch.



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ] Then you could

have marriedJordan McClanahan.



   

                   

He was another millionaire;

and he wanted to marry you.



   

                   

She just didn't want to get married.

That's all blamed on me.



   

                   

[ Edie ]

No; I never fell in love until I was    .



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ] Well; how old

are you in these pictures ?



   

                   

- Twenty-four.

- Twenty-four. That old?



   

                   

-      .

- Very young looking for twenty-four.



   

                   

France had just fallen...

to Hitler.



   

                   

- But you never fell for a man.

- Paris; Paris; excuse me.



   

                   

France fell;

but Edie didn't fall.



   

                   

That was the thing.

See; I--



   

                   

They didn't tell us that

when we studied World War I,



   

                   

that everything was so awful

with the Versailles Treaty,



   

                   

that we were soon going to get into

something four years after I got out.



   

                   

If I'd only known it,

I would have just--



   

                   

just enjoyed every single minute,

just done everything.



   

                   

[ David ] It must've been tough

on people. I remember as a kid...



   

                   

so many loved ones being killed.



   

                   

But you were the dating age.



   

                   

A lot of my friends went

overseas and got married.



   

                   

They went in the Red Cross.

They went to India, Australia.



   

                   

They all got married.



   

                   

One of my best friends

went to Australia.



   

                   

If I'd have been able to go; she

might have persuaded me to go with her.



   

                   

And she met somebody

in the hospital.



   

                   

She was working for the Red Cross,

and she never came back to New York.



   

                   

But I never had a chance

to do anything like that...



   

                   

'cause Mother wasn't well

during the war.



   

                   

She had her eye operation.



   

                   

I missed out on everything.



   

                   

I missed out on the reunion

of my graduating class in Farmington...



   

                   

because that was the fall that

Jack Kennedy campaigned to get in...



   

                   

and I was stuck here with Mother,

the cats, the house and T. Logan...



   

                   

and I couldn't go.



   

                   

- No, you said you didn't want them

to know how old you were.

- The   th reunion of my class.



   

                   

- No; I think--

- ''Well, I didn't want them

to know my age,'' says Edie.



   

                   

No; I would have enjoyed that; Mother;

becauseJack Kennedy campaigned

to get in and won.



   

                   

Get in the Farmington School ?

That'd be a good place for him.



   

                   

I don't know. I think

it would have been a lot of fun.



   

                   

Yeah, everything's good

that you didn't do.



   

                   

At the time,

you didn't want it.



   

                   

- I couldn't get away.

- Well, that's the choice.



   

                   

- You can't go back and say--

feel gorgeous right now...

- I couldn't leave.



   

                   

-and say; ''Oh; why didn't I do this ?''

- I couldn't leave.



   

                   

Because you didn't feel then

the way you do now.



   

                   

Everybody thinks and feels differently

as the years go by; don't they?



   

                   

- Yeah.

- Yes.



   

                   

- What time is it, chickens ?

-[ David ] What time is it ?



   

                   

- I want to go in now.

- It's; uh;  .:  .



   

                   

- I may need David's hand to get up.

- You have it.



   

                   

Where is it ?

Can you come around this way ?



   

                   

- Sure.

- Are you taking pictures ?



   

                   

Always. Here.



   

                   

[ Edie ]

''Two roads diverged in yellow wood...



   

                   

''and pondering; pondering both

or pondering each--



   

                   

''pondering one I took the other...



   

                   

and that made all the difference.''



   

                   

-[ Mrs. Beale ] Robert Frost.

- Isn't that wonderful ?



   

                   

- Did he say that ?

- That's all you need--

just three lines like that.



   

                   

- Come on; Edie; is that Robert Frost ?

- Who else ?



   

                   

I thought it was you.

I think your poetry is better.



   

                   

- ''Two road diverged in yellow wood...

- Come on;you said that.



   

                   

- We want something else.

- ''and pondering one, I took the other.



   

                   

- Edie;you're not teaching us.

- and that made all the difference.''



   

                   

- We don't want to learn it.

It's very pretty.

- Isn't that amazing ?



   

                   

No, I don't think it's

half as good as your poems.



   

                   

They looked the same; and he probably

couldn't tell and yet he--



   

                   

I wish I could remember

the correct lines.



   

                   

I'm absolutely exhausted.

I danced eight hours last night,



   

                   

practicing the, uh--

the marching song.



   

                   

-[ Albert ] Great.

- My God, my muscles !



   

                   

I can't do it, I'm telling you.

What a I gonna do ?



   

                   

They're gone...

with this soft life.



   

                   

[ Laughing ]



   

                   

We all march together

for love is behind



   

                   

We all stand together

United we die



   

                   

We all march together

for we love the land



   

                   

It's the spirit of V.M.I.



   

                   

We all march together

for life is unkind



   

                   

[ Laughing ]



   

                   

When they do that, that's

when the plane goes by, see ?



   

                   

So I'm doing

the V.M.I. marching song,



   

                   

which is a ground maneuver.



   

                   

Anyway, I've got to get it all

coordinated in my mind.



   

                   

Hey; Mother;

I'm working on my dance.



   

                   

-[ Mrs. Beale ] I'm starving.

-  We all march together



   

                   

-For life is unkind

- You see, she doesn't want to eat

anymore 'cause she got so fat,



   

                   

so I have to sit here

and starve all the time.



   

                   

- How can I eat and look sexy too ?

- I think I lost five pounds.



   

                   

- I'm gonna die.

- Well; don't live with me.

I want to eat.



   

                   

- Will you eat some liver pate ?

- It's not awfully good.



   

                   

- If you put lemon with it;

it's all right.

- I'm gonna die with this diet.



   

                   

- I don't like it at all.

- Don't do it. Have a sandwich.



   

                   

I got fat not wearing

clothes for two years.



   

                   

Oh; that wasn't it at all. It was

the quarts and quarts of ice cream.



   

                   

My bill was $      

just for ice cream.



   

                   

- Here's your liver pate.

- You have to make it.

I can't. No, I can't.



   

                   

I ate in front of the Maysles

the other day. You have to make it.



   

                   

I was very embarrassed. No.

I ate all that chicken--



   

                   

- Oh, Mother, I should

have stolen that blue--

- Take it out, babe.



   

                   

You like the green ?

That's chartreuse there.



   

                   

- What do I do with this ?

- You have crackers somewhere.



   

                   

- Should I put it on crackers ?

- Yeah. You should--



   

                   

It needs a lemon

or mayonnaise or something.



   

                   

When am I gonna get out of here ?



   

                   

[ Laughing ]

Oh, she's always talking like that.



   

                   

When I get to New York;you're never

gonna get me back to East Hampton.



   

                   

- Oh, that's silly.

Oh, Edie, that isn't nice.

- Ever. Never !



   

                   

Edie, the man is doing this.

For goodness sakes ! That's terrible !



   

                   

When I get to New York; brother;

I'm not ever coming back.



   

                   

Well, you got in awful trouble there.

It's a good thing you had a place

to come to.



   

                   

- Recuperate at Mama's

for about     to    years.

-[ Edie Grumbling ]



   

                   

She had a horrible time. I used to

have to send her big boxes of groceries.



   

                   

She was starving.

From my grocer's thing down there.



   

                   

- I was discovered...

- Sent her big boxes of groceries.



   

                   

-but I needed training.

- And I always put

a bottle of wine in her bag.



   

                   

I thought she'd have

a terrible accident.



   

                   

Well; I was discovered; but--

well; never mind.



   

                   

Oh, I wouldn't say anything good

happened to you in New York.



   

                   

-Are you kidding ?

- No.



   

                   

I was discovered by Mr. Gordon.

He was a friend of Mrs.--



   

                   

- Well, what is it ?

- What was that woman's name ?



   

                   

- People discover me

every time I go out, but...

- What was Ruby Chapman's--



   

                   

- I don't think anything of it.

- This is serious ! He went to pieces !



   

                   

- Mr. Max Gordon went out of his mind.

- Oh, not Max Gordon.



   

                   

- He never went to pieces in his life.

- He did !



   

                   

- He did not. A very--

- Now, what was the woman's name ?



   

                   

She gave me the letter.

Mrs. Hitchcock.



   

                   

- I can't go back to ancient history.

- Ruby Chapman's partner !



   

                   

How can you remember so long ?

Now I'll have to get drunk.



   

                   

- They gave me the letter to Max Gordon.

- I'll have to start drinking.



   

                   

I can't take it. Ah, she'll make

a drunkard out of her mother.



   

                   

What crackers do you want ?

We'll take these. Do you mind ?

They're very good.



   

                   

- Do you want these ?

- I don't like crackers. You know that.



   

                   

Just put a lemon on it.

Little lemon.



   

                   

Don't you know who Max Gordon is ?



   

                   

He's a famous producer.



   

                   

You've heard of him, haven't you ?



   

                   

- He discovered Judy Holliday.

-[ Mrs. Beale; Indistinct ]



   

                   

He discovered Judy Holliday.

He said I was much funnier.



   

                   

Well, you haven't

been funny today, boy.



   

                   

You're lacking in humor.



   

                   

It's how you are

when you grow older.



   

                   

I needed training.

Where was I to get the training ?



   

                   

- You start when you're    .

I had mine when I was    .

- Oh, stop.



   

                   

[ Humming March ]



   

                   

This cracker's

for the photographer.



   

                   

Tell me what;

what I should have done.



   

                   

Here, could you put this

away, please, Edie ?



   

                   

- I should have immediately

tried to get into something ?

- Put it where it'll get frozen.



   

                   

Until it gets frozen, will you ?



   

                   

David, instead of coming home...



   

                   

I should have tried to get into

something; is that it ?



   

                   

David; do you think you and Al

should have told Edie to lose weight ?



   

                   

-She's been impossible.

- Do you think I should have

gotten into night club work ?



   

                   

[ David ]

What does your mother think ?



   

                   

-[ Mrs. Beale ]

I had everything picked out.

- My father was alive !



   

                   

- That was it. My father was alive.

- I was going around with a--



   

                   

- My father was alive.

- Do you want to hear

what I have to say?



   

                   

Mr. Beale would have

had me committed.



   

                   

Gould and I were at Edie

every day to go to Traphagen.



   

                   

She could do anything.

She could learn toe dancing.



   

                   

She could learn radio. She could learn

all sorts of stage dancing.



   

                   

- Why was I gonna do this ?

- She could do--



   

                   

The things we told you.

We told you to go to Bendel's...



   

                   

- I couldn't go with my mother

sitting here; David.

- and model earrings.



   

                   

- I couldn't go

with my mother sitting here.

- You were so gorgeous in hats...



   

                   

and you had such a beautiful

face and we always adored you.



   

                   

And we said, ''Why, she should do hats,''

and she had gorgeous feet.



   

                   

And Mr. Beale always made her

wear a certain kind of shoe

when she was a little girl.



   

                   

Orthopedic shoe.

And she; she could have--



   

                   

I had deep responsibility

for you; Mother.



   

                   

I was taken care of for    years !



   

                   

Ah, the hallmark of aristocracy

is responsibility, is that it ?



   

                   

[ Propeller Plane Overhead ]



   

                   

I'm not gonna spend

this winter in East Hampton.

In the first place, I can't.



   

                   

I just can't. I can't spend

another winter out here in the country.



   

                   

I can't do it.

I don't enjoy it.



   

                   

Furthermore, I'm telling you,

I can't get my figure back

unless I hit New York City.



   

                   

You know.

That icebox is too near.



   

                   

I've gotta get away

from that icebox.

[ Edie ]

They all want luncheon.



   

                   

Come on.

We're gonna have luncheon.



   

                   

[ Yells ]

What ?



   

                   

-[ Mrs. Beale ] Edie!

- What ?



   

                   

I fed the cats!



   

                   

I just have to leave for New York City

and lead my own life.



   

                   

I don't see any other future.



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ] Will you shut up!

It's a goddamn beautiful day!



   

                   

Shut up!



   

                   

Paris is the place for you. Get on

stage in Paris at the Follies Bergere.



   

                   

The point is that I came down

here to take care of my mother.



   

                   

I'm sick and tired of worrying

about her night and day.



   

                   

- Well; I had a very good--

- I was away from her

for five or six years.



   

                   

- I had a very good man.

- And I was sick and tired

of lying awake at night...



   

                   

- He took care of me for    years.

- wondering what was happening

to my mother.



   

                   

She didn't have to worry.



   

                   

[ David ] Who was the man

that took care of you for    years ?



   

                   

- Twenty-three years.

- Nobody took care of her for    years.



   

                   

- I took care of this damn house

for    years.

- I'm, I'm on the air.



   

                   

Dare say my mother was ever taken care

of by any man but my father,



   

                   

and I'll push you

under the goddamned bed !



   

                   

[ David ] No; Edie;

I think Al was referring to Gould.



   

                   

Yes, he was.



   

                   

He took care of Mother by accompanying

her to the movies and playing the piano.



   

                   

Took care of me and the washing--



   

                   

No one took care of Mrs. Beale. She had

my father's money and her own money.



   

                   

- What money ?

- The Bouvier money.



   

                   

And another thing; Mrs. Beale

wasn't taken care of sexually.



   

                   

I think he was nicer than anybody

I've ever known in my whole life.



   

                   

He was a writer.

He wrote seven books at one time.



   

                   

He was brilliant. And he played

the piano magnificently...



   

                   

and composed exquisite music

and dedicated about    songs to me.



   

                   

-So Edie didn't have to worry.

- No; she didn't have to worry

the way she did; no.



   

                   

She made me leave the Barbizon.



   

                   

Well; I thought you'd been

in New York long enough.



   

                   

- You were getting lines in your face.

- But I didn't want to leave.



   

                   

- I was getting my big chance.

- Oh; no;you were not.



   

                   

That married man was not going

to give you any chance at all.



   

                   

- I was getting my audition in       !

- You were not.



   

                   

- I was going to get it !

- Well;you didn't get it.

You missed out.



   

                   

I was just getting up

what you call a little nerve.



   

                   

Now, listen, you're wasting that thing

on this, 'cause it's just nuts.



   

                   

- When she said I had to come home.

- I thought you should come home.



   

                   

-She started high-pressuring me

to come back in March of      ;

- It was time after    years.



   

                   

and she kept it up

until the end ofJuly.



   

                   

- And July   th,

I check out, got on the train,

- Well;you should come down.



   

                   

- came back,

and was never able to get back.

- It's very hot in New York.

'' Fill me with flaming desire.''



   

                   

The words are wonderful.



   

                   

Love like yours and mine

Completely on fire



   

                   

Oh, you and the night and the music



   

                   

Dance till the music is through



   

                   

I forgot. Oh, listen,

this is it. '' Love.''

[ Mrs. Beale ]

Edie! Oh; Edie!



   

                   

- Where's Jerry; Edie ?

Edie; where's Jerry?

- I don't know, Mother.



   

                   

-That's what I'm wondering.

-Don't you think you'd better find him ?



   

                   

Mother wants me to watch him

the whole time he's in the house.



   

                   

- No;you told me

not to have him back here.

- Like I watched Tom.



   

                   

- No; thanks.

- My eyes dropped out.

Mother and her friends.



   

                   

I never cared for the three

people that my mother liked.



   

                   

I couldn't get on with Mr. Beale...



   

                   

and I didn't care

for her composer friend...



   

                   

and as for Tom Logan;

he drove me crazy in the house.



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ] I loved Tom.

He played the guitar so beautifully.



   

                   

He sang and was in a rodeo;

and even was in Hollywood.



   

                   

You'd have to admire

somebody like that.



   

                   

-She was a pushover.

- He had no place to go.



   

                   

And then he asked my mother;

he said; ''I've just been fired

from the Sea Spray.



   

                   

Would you like a maintenance man ?''

Mother took him home.



   

                   

I didn't want a maintenance man.

I said, ''I'll take you home

for one night.''



   

                   

- That's the story of Tom Logan.

- That's what I said.



   

                   

There wasn't a thing

he didn't know how to do.



   

                   

He could fix anything.



   

                   

Lights, plumber things.



   

                   

He knew how to do everything.

Just one of those terribly clever men.



   

                   

He couldn't do any work. He made good

salads, but he was drunk all the time.



   

                   

Oh, no. He came up here every morning

at  :   knocked on my door.



   

                   

We talked over

the menu for the day.



   

                   

Including a half a bottle

of rose vin...



   

                   

or wine or whatever it's called.



   

                   

Naturally; we couldn't get rid

of him; and I had to stay here.



   

                   

What I should have done is leave;

and he would have left right away.



   

                   

All right;you don't believe

in religious compulsion.

It was a religious thing.



   

                   

- If I had left, he would have left.

- No; I deserve--



   

                   

- Because the work

would have been too much.

- He didn't want to go.



   

                   

All alone in the house for Tom.

All I had to do was leave.

I'm so stupid that I--



   

                   

Well; where would I have been ?

I'd have been all alone in the house.



   

                   

I think you would have, Mother.



   

                   

-[ Mrs. Beale ] Edie! Yoo-hoo!

- What ?



   

                   

The Marble Faun is at the door.

He can wait.



   

                   

LetJerry in. Hurry up.



   

                   

I'm gonna look at this path

withoutJerry.



   

                   

[ Humming ]



   

                   

This is a sea of leaves.

A complete sea of leaves.



   

                   

If you lose something;you can't

find it again;:it drops to the bottom.



   

                   

I lost my scarf.

I'll never get it again.



   

                   

Best scarf I ever owned.

The most beautiful color of blue.



   

                   

It dropped.

You know; it fell off my head.



   

                   

[ Whispering ]

To hell with the Marble Faun.



   

                   

- Hello ?

- Hello; Edie.



   

                   

Oh, hello,Jerry darling.

Do you want to come in ?



   

                   

I just came for the faucet

so I can get down to the hardware store.



   

                   

- Yeah; Mother said you called.

Was that you on the phone very early?

- Yeah.



   

                   

How are you ?

I'm looking at you now.



   

                   

Really well.



   

                   

I'll come down and let you in.

Do you want to come up here ?



   

                   

- You want to come up ?

-All right; for a moment.



   

                   

Mother's screaming to have me

let you in. I'd better do it.



   

                   

I'll be at the back door

here, okay ?



   

                   

I'll come right down.



   

                   

-Jerry's puffing and blowing.

- No. I'm tired, and I don't

want to get any tireder.



   

                   

What do you want,Jerry ?

Who wants a nice piece of corn ?



   

                   

No. I don't want any.

Thank you.



   

                   

Jerry;you didn't get

enough to eat tonight.



   

                   

- Well; I can't resist. I'm sorry.

- The margarine.



   

                   

Jerry, you're gonna put

some of this on, aren't you ?



   

                   

- You wanna do it for me ?

- Why, yeah. The pleasure's all mine.



   

                   

If I don't burn myself.



   

                   

Which piece of corn

do you want,Jerry ?



   

                   

- Doesn't matter.

-See how polite he is ?



   

                   

You want some; Edie ?

Where's your plate;Jerry; for it ?



   

                   

- I couldn't eat in front of the camera.

- I've got very big hands.



   

                   

-[ Edie Laughs ]

- This corn is out of this world.



   

                   

Oh, did I do it nicely ? He always

compliments me on the way I do my corn.



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale Chuckles ]



   

                   

-[ Clattering ]

- [ Edie ] There they are.



   

                   

There are your raccoons.

Run away from your drinks

and do that to your raccoons.



   

                   

[ Albert ]

Hear him ?



   

                   

[ Edie ]

Yeah; he's there. I can hear him.



   

                   

Everything's in the attic;

everything from sloths; otters;



   

                   

badgers; uh; possums; raccoons.



   

                   

I don't leave the bags anymore.



   

                   

'Cause I had to get up to    

cellophane bags this, uh--



   

                   

Horrors. Somebody's removing

the books from my room.



   

                   

Where did this little book

come from ?



   

                   

[Jerry ]

Edie!



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ]

That's Jerry. He locked himself out.



   

                   

No,Jerry hasn't

locked himself out.



   

                   

[ Chuckles ]

He locked himself out.



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ]

Who's knocking at the door?



   

                   

[Jerry ]

Who is it ?



   

                   

[ Whispering ]

He's around there.



   

                   

Who got this book out of my room ?

I cleaned this whole attic up

the other day.



   

                   

Now, who's been dropping books

around is what I want to know.



   

                   

I would have seen that book.



   

                   

He evidently has been

up in that room reading it.



   

                   

All right, Buster, old pal,

come and get it.



   

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ] There's somebody

knocking at the door; Edie.



   

                   

Yeah, all right, Mother.



   

                   

-[ Heavy Knocking ]

- Yes ?



   

                   

[ Man ]

Is Jerry here ?



   

                   

Oh, yes. I'll get him for you.

Just a minute. Hey,Jerry.



   

                   

- Yeah ?

- I think your friend's

in the, in the, uh, front.



   

                   

I found a little book

dropped in the attic; Mother.



   

                   

- He's been up there.

- Well;you should keep him out.



   

                   

He told me he was working

on that thing;:he wasn't at all.



   

                   

- Want a little bit, Edie ?

- No.



   

                   

- You don't want a little bit ?

-[ David Mutters ]



   

                   

- My God!

- What ?



   

                   

- I just thought of something.

- What ?



   

                   

Give me that. What did you think of?

What ? Come on.



   

                   

[ Whispering ]

The guy was standing outside the window,



   

                   

and he was passing books out to him.



   

                   

- You think so, Edie ?

- Yes.



   

                   

- I don't believe all that.

- Yes!



   

                   

I don't believe it.

Want a taste, Edie ?



   

                   

- I don't want any.

- No. We lost the glasses.

The glasses are gone.



   

                   

Next thing; those antiques

will all be missing.



   

                   

See, you shouldn't have

a contact with the outside world...



   

                   

because how do I know that

there isn't something up in that room ?



   

                   

If you get what I mean.



   

                   

You can't tell what's

been put up in that room...



   

                   

or what's been taken out.



   

                   

- [ Sighs ]

- Don't worry so much; please.



   

                   

This cat's going to the bathroom

right in back of my portrait.



   

                   

- Oh; isn't that awful?

- No; I'm glad he is.



   

                   

I'm glad somebody's doing

something they want to do.



   

                   

[ David Laughing ]



   

                   

I was frozen this morning

when I woke up. Were you, Edie ?



   

                   

- I did drop. It dropped.

It dropped quite a bit.

- I missed you last night.



   

                   

I was so lonely. She only left me

one little kitty to keep me warm.



   

                   

And all these blankets were on the

floors, all this pile of stuff here.



   

                   

Jerry's pretty good at waiting on me.



   

                   

He can find things here that

I wouldn't find for half an hour.



   

                   

- [ David ] Jerry; the major domo.

- I'm so sick of that kid.



   

                   

- I have great pity for him.

- Lois says--

Well;you know the trouble.



   

                   

- And I like him, but--

- Lois says-- You know the trouble.



   

                   

-[ David ] What ?

- The trouble is,

he's madly in love with Edie.



   

                   

I said I thought Edie was madly

in love with him. Pardon me.



   

                   

He might as well leave right now,

'cause he's never gonna get it.



   

                   

- So that's it.

- Get what ? Sex with you ?



   

                   

- What he's after.

- He doesn't want any sex with you.



   

                   

- Well, that's all they're after.

-An old person like you ? Good God!



   

                   

- So why don't you tell him right now ?

- Unheard of. Unheard of.



   

                   

- You should tell him right now

so I'm not bothered by him.

- He doesn't want sex.



   

                   

He's got about six girls

in East Hampton. He's so busy.



   

                   

- No, but the point is, he thinks--

- I don't know what he's doing.



   

                   

He's out every single night

with a different girl.



   

                   

- Yeah, but that's,

that's the point, you see.

- He had a wonderful time.



   

                   

- He's gonna be here for years

and years. I see this coming.

- He enjoys himself thoroughly.



   

                   

- I hope.

- The guy's gonna be here

for years and years.



   

                   

- I doubt that.

- It's gonna be one of those things.



   

                   

Like Tom Logan.



   

                   

Aren't you gonna feed Whiskers; Edie ?



   

                   

Come on; go in and feed Whiskers.



   

                   

Now, don't eat it.

Give it to Whiskers, please.



   

                   

- You're thin. You want to get thin.

- She's very mean to me.



   

                   

No. I have to be very strict.

The priest said she needed

a very strict hand.



   

                   

[ Laughs ]

What the priest told me.



   

                   

[ Imitating Irish Accent ]

''She sure needs a very strong

hand, your daughter.''



   

                   

And I tried to give it to her,

you know that ?



   

                   

After Mr. Beale, you know,

stopped living in East Hampton,



   

                   

I had a terrible

hard time with Edie.



   

                   

She just went wild after

her father wasn't living here.



   

                   

She went wild, absolutely wild.



   

                   

I couldn't do anything

with her at all.



   

                   

Isn't it awful

when a dancer gets fat ?



   

                   

Isn't it awful ? God.



   

                   

It's awful, I'm telling you.

It's awful ! God !



   

                   

My father believed in running

the children's lives, you know ?



   

                   

He wanted me to get my master's degree,

be a junior partner in his law firm.



   

                   

- Take the ice cream.

- He was      Broadway;



   

                   

on the ninth floor,

and my knees would start to shake...



   

                   

coming down on the ninth floor

of Mr. Beale's offiice.



   

                   

My knees were rattling.

My mouth was dry.



   

                   

You were scared of your father.



   

                   

And I'd go in, and he'd

come forward out of his office

with his watch in his hand,



   

                   

and then he'd look at the clock

on the wall, and he'd say,



   

                   

''You're five minutes late,''

he'd say. Oh, my God.



   

                   

- No; he had a very--

- And then he'd sit down

and look at me like this...



   

                   

and say, ''Take it off.

Take that hat off.



   

                   

''Take that lipstick off.

Take that nail polish off.



   

                   

- How dare you wear those high heels !''

- Oh; she's just acting.



   

                   

Don't you want some of this ?

Butter pecan.



   

                   

Mmm. Mmm.



   

                   

He said the only thing

to be was a professional woman.



   

                   

He did say that.

Didn't he, Mother ?



   

                   

Well, I wouldn't say

it's the only thing.



   

                   

He didn't want me to get married.



   

                   

I don't think people should get married.

I don't believe in it at all.



   

                   

If you can't get a man to propose

to you, you might as well be dead.



   

                   

- Oh; I don't think it's important.

- I think it's disgusting,



   

                   

- Aunt Mary had the most wonderful life.

- absolutely disgusting...



   

                   

- Lived to be    years of age.

- to live alone.



   

                   

What are they proving ?

They have to around with dogs

or other women or something.



   

                   

- Dogs are lovely.

- I, I think it's terrible.



   

                   

I'll take a dog any day.

[ Chuckles ]



   

                   

Why didn't you marry the man

you wanted to, like I did ?



   

                   

I think the saddest thing was my not

marrying into the Obelensky family...



   

                   

'cause I adore them.



   

                   

- Any Obelensky is wonderful.

That's all I can say.

- He's a very sweet man.



   

                   

If he's related to

the Obelenskys; he's okay.



   

                   

- I didn't know he was

any relation to them.

- Yes.



   

                   

-I never knew it.

-Serge's; uh; nephew by his half-sister.



   

                   

Now, there was a boy

I might have married.



   

                   

Why didn't you marry

Paul Getty ?



   

                   

I said; ''How did you

happen to come here ?''



   

                   

And he said; ''Oh; I saw you at a dance; ''

he said; ''in South Hampton. ''



   

                   

- I said, ''You did ?'' He said, ''Yes.''

- He was just a kid.



   

                   

He was    . And I said;

''Eugene; what you need is a girl. ''



   

                   

And he said; ''No; Edith; I'm looking

for a wife. I wanna get married. ''



   

                   

- He wanted to take Edie to Westchester.

- Wasn't that cute ?



   

                   

Tom had just died; and I did not

want another man in my kitchen.



   

                   

- I went downstairs--

- He'd just made a cookbook.

He'd just written a cookbook.



   

                   

- Mother got rid of him in     minutes.

- Don't want any cookbooks.



   

                   

Mother got rid of him

in     minutes because he came

from a celebrated family.



   

                   

The Tyszkiewicz family.

And I suppose mother didn't want me

to have anybody that was decent.



   

                   

- You understand.

- I didn't want anybody in the kitchen.



   

                   

It would have been perfectly

all right for me to marry Tom Logan.



   

                   

Why did you want to marry

a kid     ?



   

                   

- I forgot to say

that Eugene was a count.

- He didn't have a nickel.



   

                   

I would have been Countess--

Countess Edith.



   

                   

I didn't want my child to be taken away.

I'd be entirely alone.



   

                   

Do you know what I go through

with this awful stuff?



   

                   

Listen; I've got to eat lunch.

I'm starving.



   

                   

Well, you know me--

always hungry.



   

                   

- [ Door Closes ]

- I'm not gonna gain the weight back.



   

                   

I didn't have any breakfast.



   

                   

- I'll put some lipstick on.

- You want to give me something

to put on; Edie ?



   

                   

[ Giggles ]

I'm beginning to laugh.



   

                   

- These are my brother's drawers.

- Give me something to put on.



   

                   

And I feel so strongly about mementos

and everything because of Mother...



   

                   

that I was never able to ever

clean out these desk drawers

and throw the stuff away.



   

                   

- Would you believe that ?

You know, it's childhood stuff.

-[ Mrs. Beale; Indistinct ]



    

                   

- Oh; Edie;yoo-hoo!

- '' Memorabalia'' or something.



    

                   

- Edie;yoo-hoo!

- I couldn't throw anything away.



    

                   

- They're looking at this room.

- Oh; Edie!



    

                   

Yeah,just a minute.



    

                   

They discovered something

terrific in here.



    

                   

- Come on. I've waited long enough.

- Is it from Austria ?



    

                   

- Why; what happened?

- Never mind about me.



    

                   

[ Edie ] ''The moving finger writes

and; having writ; moves on. ''



    

                   

I was going to write

another line from Omar Khayyam.:



    

                   

''We come like water

and we go like wind.''



    

                   

Edie;yoo-hoo!



    

                   

- Well, I got that one up.

- Edie; bring me the telephone.



    

                   

That's the man.

This is the woman.



    

                   

- I can't tell.

-Are you getting me

the blue kimono; Edie ?



    

                   

I'm putting up the silver masks.



    

                   

Edie; come here a minute. Hurry.



    

                   

I can't get the thumbtack

in the wall.



    

                   

- I think I have the saddest life.

- Oh; Edie!



    

                   

I have to go on with

the redecoration of this room.



    

                   

- Yeah.

- Can you get me something to eat ?



    

                   

All right.



    

                   

[ Edie ]

I made this.



    

                   

Those are roses

of all different years.



    

                   

That's my shell collection.

You can't see it; it's so dirty.

Isn't that tragic ?



    

                   

That's-- These--

Then I have two things to go there.



    

                   

And ''Around the World''

is supposed to go there.



    

                   

Edie; I can't do it.



    

                   

- Open it. I can't do it.

- I'm just gonna put that up there...



    

                   

'cause I like red

in this room for some reason.



    

                   

And I was gonna hang

the birdcage right here...



    

                   

and have

''Around the World'' there.



    

                   

But I haven't gotten to that.



    

                   

Perhaps I'd better begin taking

care of Mother and bossing her

and cooking her some food.



    

                   

- What do you boys think ?

-[ David ] Bossing her around?



    

                   

Yeah.

I let her do what she wants.



    

                   

I think maybe I ought to give her

cooked meals at certain hours.



    

                   

What do you think ?

I don't have any clock.



    

                   

You know,

I never know what time it is.



    

                   

You think she'd eat them ?



    

                   

I don't know. You know her

better than anybody.



    

                   

I give her her head. I let her do what

she wants to do. I think it's awful.



    

                   

She should eat, you know,

chopped meat and a baked potato

at a certain hour for luncheon.



    

                   

Then have a nice little dinner.



    

                   

But that takes timing.



    

                   

No, I'm not ready,

and I have no makeup on !



    

                   

-[ Albert Laughing ]

- But things are getting better !



    

                   

Did you find my sign,

''In bathtub'' ?



    

                   

Right.

I couldn't believe it.



    

                   

Come on in.

We're not ready.



    

                   

-[ Mrs. Beale ]

Is that Al down there ? Hello; Al.

-[ Albert ] Yeah. Hi.



    

                   

- Take your time.

- Oh, God ! I almost tripped.



    

                   

I almost broke my neck then.

God, these stairs are dirty.



    

                   

Oh.

[ Giggles ]



    

                   

[ Indistinct Chattering ]



    

                   

How could Edie leave

these stairs like this ?



    

                   

Don't I look funny

coming down these stairs, hmm ?



    

                   

-[ David ] No. You look great.

- Don't I ? I feel funny.



    

                   

I feel funny.



    

                   

-Just like a night at the opera.

- Is it ?



    

                   

The night at the opera will be when

I get in that chair in the dining room.



    

                   

That would be the night

at the opera.



    

                   

-[ Edie ]

Mother; Lois andJack are here!

- Hello,Jack.



    

                   

-[ Lois ] Happy birthday!

- [ Chatters, Indistinct ]



    

                   

I say, where's the cushion, Edie ?

Get the cushion. I'll ruin my dress.



    

                   

- Oh;yes. She puts it here.

- Oh, God, and those chairs.



    

                   

Are they dirty, those chairs.

Hello,Jack.



    

                   

- Hi, how are you ? Happy birthday.

-[ Mrs. Beale Giggles ]



    

                   

Well;you're very cute

to celebrate with me today.



    

                   

-[ Edie ]

I like you in that costume; Lois.

- Oh, why, thank you.



    

                   

[ Edith ] I see Edie hasn't--

You better not sit on those chairs.



    

                   

- They look very dirty.

- They can sit on paper.



    

                   

I thought you were gonna

clean up; Edie.



    

                   

I tried.

I swept the, uh, hall.



    

                   

Well, I'm kind of disapp-- Jack,

you don't mind sitting by me, do you ?



    

                   

I swept the floor. We have wine.

I'll bring down the glasses.



    

                   

Bring down the wine, please.



    

                   

- And Edie is due--

Lois is due ginger ale.

- Okay.



    

                   

But don't let the cats out.



    

                   

How do you like that thing

Lois did for me,Jack ?



    

                   

Are your eyes good enough

to see that ?



    

                   

- Oh; sure.

- How are your eyes ?



    

                   

[ Edie Giggling ]



    

                   

- She's no waitress, I'll tell ya.

- [ Giggling Continues ]



    

                   

Well, she's got

a pretty heavy tray.



    

                   

Leave the tray here, won't you ?

Oh, no, she's not gonna.



    

                   

She's gonna do

just as she wants, you know.



    

                   

She's a Schrafft's waitress.

They always do just as they want.



    

                   

Here's to Mother.

May she live to be at least   .



    

                   

-[ Mrs. Beale ]

Oh; it's one more year. Ha; ha.

- She's in her    th.



    

                   

- She's in her    th now--    th year.

-[ Radio Announcer; Indistinct ]



    

                   

She's gonna tell that to everybody

in East Hampton, you know.



    

                   

-[Jack ] Well; that's life.

- Everybody's gonna know my age.



    

                   

- Well; happy birthday.

- Thank you very much.



    

                   

-[ Lois ] Happy birthday

- Sing me '' Happy Birthday.'' Sing it.



    

                   

- I sang it.

- Do it again.



    

                   

-  Happy birthday to you

-Happy birthday



    

                   

-[ Lois ] Very good.

-  Happy birthday



    

                   

Dear Mother



    

                   

-[ Mrs. Beale Laughing ]

-  Happy birthday



    

                   

To you



    

                   

Why do we have to have

paper cups when I wanted my--



    

                   

I wanted my green goblets

with all the gold on 'em;

and she wouldn't bring 'em down.



    

                   

-[ Radio.: Commercial ]

- So disappointed on my birthday.



    

                   

Sugar-free Diet Pepsi is here



    

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ] Oh; what a beautiful--

I knew I wanted to look at that cake!



    

                   

Did you ever see anything

like that ?



    

                   

- '' Happy Birthday.'' Gorgeous !

-[ Phone Ringing ]



    

                   

- Imagine having red--

Somebody's calling me, Edie.

- That's terrific.



    

                   

- My sister ordered that

out of Sag Harbor.

-[ Edie ] Hello ? Yeah.



    

                   

- Hey, Mother, can you move

your chair a little bit ?

- Yeah.



    

                   

This is the first time we've used

the long wire in the dining room.



    

                   

Oh, hello, Polly.



    

                   

Thank you, dear. Are you gonna sing it

all the way through ?



    

                   

[ Giggles ] Listen,

I got your beautiful present.



    

                   

- Uh, Edie, have you brought

the present down yet ?

- I haven't opened any presents.



    

                   

We're sitting down here

in the so-called old--



    

                   

- What, dear ?

- We haven't opened anything.



    

                   

There's a great big box up there.



    

                   

Tremendous box; but we haven't

opened the presents



    

                   

Well, you sent me a card.

I got that.



    

                   

I don't think she did

send Mother a card.



    

                   

Michele sent the cards.



    

                   

I haven't started the cake;

but I'll read you what it says.



    

                   

It says; uh--

What does it say;Jack ?



    

                   

Edith; happy birthday--

Oh; it says; ''Happy birthday; Edith. ''



    

                   

- And that's all in red.

-[Jack ] Yes.



    

                   

And then the flowers

underneath are--



    

                   

Well, yellow flowers and green.



    

                   

It's a perfectly enormous cake.



    

                   

Oh ! [ Laughs ]



    

                   

Thank you; dear. Hang up.



    

                   

- Did you say good-bye ?

Did you say good-bye ?

- That's the girl you hated.



    

                   

[Jack ] Are they having eye trouble ?

They freeze your eyes.



    

                   

- Both of them have been operated.

-[ Edie ] They had to have operations.



    

                   

- They both had two operations.

-And then they weren't good; either.



    

                   

One lost her eye. One girl.



    

                   

Yeah; the eyes disappeared--

dried up and disappeared.



    

                   

She has double vision. She has to wear

dark glasses over the cataract glasses.



    

                   

She's absolutely cured; Edie!



    

                   

-She's cured now.

- Did she say she was cured ?



    

                   

She said; ''I feel wonderful. ''



    

                   

The really nice thing to have

is to get deaf and get blind...



    

                   

and then have some cancer

come in your face and your lips.



    

                   

- Cancer?

- Cancer of the tongue

or something like that.



    

                   

- Yeah, cancer is worse.

- Yeah.



    

                   

[ Lois ] You want to open

my little presents and then--



    

                   

Yeah; I am. Edith;you ever

see anything as cute as this ?



    

                   

[ Lois ] A little pad there

you can write your requests on.



    

                   

I need that more than anything

to write things down.



    

                   

I have my things written all over boxes,

all over the bed, everywhere.



    

                   

I got Epstein's address.



    

                   

I've got--

Who have I got there, Edie ?



    

                   

All the electricians

in East Hampton.



    

                   

- All of'em. Isn't that

a nice book, Edie ? Look.

- Terrific.



    

                   

I can't be late now

and I can't forget.



    

                   

And I can't hate anybody

and I can't do anything.



    

                   

The little book is gonna keep me

straight. Straight as a die.



    

                   

Isn't that nice ? I haven't had

a little thing like that in ages.



    

                   

- I had a wonderful time.

- Your hands are cold.

It did you no good, my food.



    

                   

- Oh, no.

- Your hands are cold, lady.



    

                   

[Jack ]

Well; I must be on my course; I guess.



    

                   

- [ Edie ] Good-bye.

- Well, so long, fellas.



    

                   

Thank you for your card and your

ice cream. I love you very much.



    

                   

Oh; especially the ice cream.



    

                   

[ Door Closes ]



    

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ]

Bring me my yellow cushion; Edie.



    

                   

- Yeah.

- The cats are in here.

Did you know it ?



    

                   

The cats are in with me.



    

                   

Will you turn the heat off?

It is terribly hot in here.



    

                   

[ Edie ] Your room is terribly dirty.

It's got to be cleaned.



    

                   

- Not tonight; Geraldine.

- There's a horrible smell.

I can hardly sit here.



    

                   

I love that smell. I thrive on it.

Makes me feel good.



    

                   

We have to hang the portrait

and clean the room.



    

                   

No ! Pull the chair out !

He wants to look at it !



    

                   

I'm not ashamed of anything. Where

my body is is a very precious place.



    

                   

It's ''concentrated''ground.

[ Giggles ]



    

                   

[ David ]

Consecrated.



    

                   

[ Mrs. Beale ] What are they doing ?

Take a picture of Edie.



    

                   

I'm trying to think of--

Oh, I know what I can have.

Oh, for goodness sakes, he is.



    

                   

My God. They see me as-- You know,

She can really sing decently.



    

                   

Sings very well.

Better voice than I have.



    

                   

But not that song.



    

                   

Now sing ''Only a Rose; ''now; Edie.

You ought to be able to do that.



    

                   

Go on. Sing it.

Only a rose



    

                   

Only a rose



    

                   

Another day



    

                   

-  Only a rose

-  [ Humming ]



    

                   

I give you only a rose



    

                   

- Dying away.

-  Dying away



    

                   

Only a rose



    

                   

To keep in harmony.



    

                   

- [ Laughs ]  To keep in harmony

-  To keep in harmony



    

                   

-  Only--  [ Laughs ]

-[ Mrs. Beale Laughs ]



    

                   

I don't think there's

any point in my meeting anybody

that doesn't like music, do you ?



    

                   

'Cause I can't stand them.

Finally; I can't stand them.



    

                   

There's something lacking;

and it's music; isn't it ?



    

                   

I mean; in a man.



    

                   

Well, it is nice to have a man

who can play the piano for you.



    

                   

- No; that isn't all.

She doesn't get it.

- You can practice.



    

                   

Unless a man understands music; there's

no point in my even meeting him...



    

                   

'cause I never could figure out

what was wrong.



    

                   

You know; with stockbrokers

and tennis players and--



    

                   

I tell you who was a songwriter

and a dancer and a playwright

and everything.



    

                   

Eugene Tyszkiewicz.

But Mother got rid of him in     minutes.



    

                   

- He didn't speak English well.

He'd only been here seven years.

- You didn't try his cooking.



    

                   

- He might've poisoned you.

- He was Serge Obelensky's nephew.



    

                   

-You wanna marry a stranger?

-I mean, he was a very, very decent guy.



    

                   

- I looked up his horoscope.

He was born November the    th.

- You want to marry a stranger?



    

                   

- I have to go in now.

- We was a very wonderful boy.

Too young for me, probably--    .



    

                   

- Who was this ?

- Eugene Tyszkiewicz. He was a twin.



    

                   

- I couldn't stand having

another cook in this house.

- That isn't the point.



    

                   

And he actually proposed,

under the window.



    

                   

- He had no home.

He was living in a third-class hotel.

- Under the window.



    

                   

- He didn't have a thing.

- He said, '' Edith, if you want

to get married, I'll marry you.''



    

                   

- Not one single nickel.

- And I think that

was decent, don't you ?



    

                   

- I don't see why.

- He probably wouldn't have,

but just the same.



    

                   

Not one person had entered

Grey Gardens for many years...



    

                   

before Eugene Tyszkiewicz

came around.



    

                   

So I credit him

with all the nerve in the world.



    

                   

Why; no one

would even speak to us.



    

                   

People who I had walked

to the Maidstone Club with for years.



    

                   

- Don't believe a word of it.

- Admiring all the other people.



    

                   

- Don't believe

a word of it, kid. Not a word.

- All the other people--



    

                   

- [ Rambling ]

- If your father could hear you,

he'd turn in his grave.



    

                   

He'd say, '' My God, Edie !''



    

                   

Well; anyway; I think

you were very cruel; Mother.



    

                   

- Well, I don't think it's nice.

- He came from one of the best

families in Poland.



    

                   

And he was related to the Obelenskys.



    

                   

And I think it's terrible that

she wouldn't give me a chance

with Eugene Tyszkiewicz.



    

                   

- That was absolutely cruel

to drive the only beau away !

- But he was     !



    

                   

- Do you want to marry a man     ?

- I don't care !

That was the only one...



    

                   

besides these horrible people

that came around here !



    

                   

- Have you got your thing

lighted for that ?

-[ David ] Yeah; we're all lit.



    

                   

- He was only    

and from a very good family !

-     and she's    !



    

                   

And she got rid of him

in     minutes flat !



    

                   

- No, he didn't. He said--

- I'm bored with all these

awful people likeJerry !



    

                   

- And all those people !

- That wasn't the truth. No.



    

                   

Tell him the truth.

That was not the truth.



    

                   

Uh, no,

and that was not the truth.



    

                   

He said, '' How could such a warm,

lovely person over the telephone...



    

                   

turn into anything so cold ?''



    

                   

That's what he said

right down on the porch.



    

                   

So I said, I said,

''You'd better go home.''

Never said good-bye or anything.



    

                   

'' How could such a warm,

lovely woman over the telephone

turn into something so cold ?''



    

                   

I thought that was just

a little too much.



    

                   

Uh, I'll tell you the whole thing.

You might as well face it.



    

                   

It's my mother's house,

and she owns it,



    

                   

and she wanted the people

she wanted in it...



    

                   

and she didn't want

the people that I wanted in it.



    

                   

But God knows whom I wanted in it.



    

                   

I mean; besides Eugene;

and Mother wouldn't allow Eugene

to stay even     minutes.



    

                   

But I had to spend ten years

with Tom Logan.



    

                   

And now we haveJerry

who is Mother's friend.



    

                   

So, you just can't do

anything about it.



    

                   

So I can see now

why girls get married.



    

                   

You know,

they're forced into it.



    

                   

It's all a question

of who you want to stay with.



    

                   

Of course, I'm mad about animals,

but raccoons and cats

become a little bit boring.



    

                   

I mean, for too long a time.



    

                   

[ Laughs ]



    

                   

I don't know.



    

                   

I don't know.

I better check on Mother and the cats.



    

                   

She's a lot of fun.

I hope she doesn't die.



    

                   

I hate to spend the winter here;

though. Oh; God.



    

                   

Another winter.



    

                   

[ Whispering ] Very depressing,

you know, when winter sets in here.



    

                   

You know, 'cause I don't like the

country, and I don't want to be here.



    

                   

Any little rat--



    

                   

Any little rat's nest in New York,



    

                   

any little mouse hole,

any little rat hole,



    

                   

even on Tenth Avenue,

I would like better.



    

                   

[ Phonograph.:Big Band ]



    

                   

Beneath the moon and the sun



    

                   

Too near or far



    

                   

No matter, darling where you are



    

                   

I think of you



    

                   

Night and day



    

                   

[ Continues; Indistinct ]



    

                   

Silence of my lonely room



    

                   

I think of you



    

                   

The magic



    

                   

Of dreams come true
