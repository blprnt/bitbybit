Golden Streams
Golden stream 
In the cold 
It turns to ice 
Runs down my knees in fright
Golden stream 
Turns from warm to cold
 In frightful time
 In the frozen dead of night
The golden stone builds the golden road to heaven 
Held up high by golden streams of ice
 My golden bone meets the golden bun
 Buns held high in our dreams of men
Golden streams of ice In the cold 
Hold up a city of gold 
That lives in broad daylight
Two golden streams
 Run down my cheeks 
When buns are deprived 
Of my dreams of men
I hold the golden bone on the golden road to heaven 
Held up high by golden streams of ice 
The golden bone belongs in golden bun 
Bone and bun held high in my dreams of us
My golden wand waves down your golden rod
 Our gold held high in sunny breezy sky 
Then a stream of gold released from golden stone 
Erupts late at night and melts the winter ice
The golden streams 
The golden streams
 The golden streams

Ban Marriage
I was late getting to church on the morning of my ceremony
Stayed up too late, the night before  from fingering foreign dirty holes in the dark 
The morning sun blinded my eyes And made my skin look pale and taint in light
And there were steps to climb as I unloosened my tie 
As I began to walk the aisle  the congregation looked behind 
but I continued past the pews  and met my angel in a suit with a smile
As I looked him in the eye, I heard my best friend cry
 We aren't fools to fall in love but let coupledom die
Ban marriage, ban marriage
The minister was drunk and high from  his rewrite of holy verse with more lies 
But the organist she played  with a tenacity and grace that was fine
The whole room was filled with the thunder and flood
 With just one chord, the thrill and clarity of sound
But soon the song went slowly dead
 And I was forced to take a stand on one side
 It was him or my fag hag, oh, well I guess, she was never that good of a friend
After my fag hag friend had fled  the minister looked mighty fed and content 
We said his rewritten vows that I could hardly pronounce 
But was soon drowned it out by that organ and the shout of
Ban marriage, ban marriage
 Ban marriage, ban marriage
The congregation, stunned and dumbed  looked upon me with an innocuous stare
 I wept and on my knees I prayed that
There be truth and there be light in my day
In my hungover daze, I felt the thunder of God
 It was the orders that I take the wrath upon my own rod 
Then I repeated my own vows 
They were perverted and they smelled of myself
That there is splendor in the harshness of bum
 That consummation makes a grumble 
And the sound that I have learned called
Ban marriage, ban marriage 
Ban marriage, ban marriage 
Ban marriage, ban it all


Sent from god 
A holy visit 
I wake up in the night 
"What is it" 
I'm startled and I'm cold and I believe that I have problems in my dreams 
I feel like I'm the only one and that I carry your disease  
In my head you are suffering 
In my head you are  
He brings me flowers that are gold and honey from the bees 
He places a blossom in my hair and undresses me 
He tells me that I'm the only one that can carry his disease 
I'm made to be an animal by his love and to bear his baby  
In my head you are suffering 
In my head you are 
In my head you are suffering 
In my head you are


That’s when the ceremony starts 

The spark in his eye was sign he was alive

I cleaned his feet to be complete

I drank from the wine that came from inside
The heart of his meat and the splurge of his sweet

That's when the ceremony starts

I hold the cup to my breast as he wets my neck

There's a book and a blade then to alternate

Think of the wind in his eyes and of suicide
With poppers blind, it's wedged inside

I beg and plead to be underneath
The man with bread who wakens me
He curls his breath and turns the dead
It winds inside to fertilize

That's when the ceremony starts

With a wreath and a sigh and a veil and a thigh

The comfort brief, impure, and sweet

To burn incense and break the bread
With honey spread, his warmth, his chest

He blushes and bleeds, he breathes then feeds
It was the spark in his eye that was sign he'd survived

That's when the ceremony starts

It was the spark in his eye that was sign he'd survived




I Believe In The Good Of Life

I believe in the good of life

I believe in the good of life as I kneel for a taste of man
I believe in the taste of wine as I do not step on a land mine

I believe in the good of life as I kneel for a taste of man
I believe in the taste of wine as I do not step on a land mine

I'll testify on the world of radio that I dream of the fate of democracy, as I flee on my bike from the crimes we made, and that I did not do those drugs or steal those army pants.

Fear is on 

The fear is on as I try to write
His father's gone, but I can't unwind
When the fear is on

He's the one as I read what he writes
He thrills, but he's gone, and I can't calm down
It's tears he wants as I try to hide
The only one

Tender touch is an empty life
The spirit is gone as I try to run
When the fear is on






He is the Boss of Me

He is the boss of me
He gives me hugs and sugar lumps
When my heart’s gone bitter
He is the boss of me
He makes me coffee and
I write him a letter like I’m a poet or an ancestor
He is the boss of me
He tells me where to go, so I go, I just go
He’s never done me wrong but he never wants to sing my songs
Cause he is my walrus and I am his blubber, his lover

He is the boss of me
We walk until we hit the shore
Then we walk more, he walks more than me
He is the boss of me
My left foot walks to the rhythm of his
We march like we are children in an army club
He is the boss of me
He gives me a sensual touch and marks a trail of human blood he calls angel dust
The pearl in his hand is the jewel that will make me a man
Cause he is my walrus and I am his blubber, his lover
The pearl in his hand is the jewel that will make me a man
Cause he is my walrus and I am his blubber, his lover 
The Day I Left Home

I burned everything I own, left it in a pile smoldering
Took about on foot out into the wood like an animal
Hap’d upon a tree, slept there underneath the birds and planes
Woke up to find that I was alone

Took a man’s ride with an eagle eye I was careless
Rolling down the road, in from the cold I was tripping
He took me to his lair said we should be married with a grin
I refuse to make amends
Refuse to wallow anymore

So I telephoned my friend to take the upper hand for the first time
Down on knees digging out the weeds of all the years
I reserve the right to speak
Reserve my right to let it all out
One day you’ll see that I’m gone 

The first time was the best time, the hurt and crying was heaven
It filled me with an ache filled me with the shake of an earthquake
The next time well it was fine, dignified but it wore away
I‘ll be searching to find the words I need to revolt 
The day the words simplify
Is the day you get home and you see that I
When you fall in love and you realize I’m gone




Big Blue

In the way they walk with their hands all upon you
And the slur of speech is intended to baffle you
By the word of fact they are swayed by opinion
It is enough to get the best of anybody down

Does anybody know why they call it the big blue?
Can anybody know why they call it the big blue?

In the year of talk he mimed about innocence
And his hands in jest told them he was the only one
The world outside is enough to confound you
Until the urge to speak is subverted by everyone

Can anybody teach me to swallow the big blue?
Can anybody hold me to follow the big blue?

When word broke out they tumbled like an avalanche
It was the year that saw all seasons compounded
As they pray out loud that their eyes may be gouged out
So that the blue turns red and our senses are the only ones

Can anybody beg me to swallow the big blue?
Can anybody really know how to love the big blue?
Does anybody know why they call it the big blue?
Does anybody really know how to swallow the big blue?

Had a Feeling ‘Bout You

I had a feeling ‘bout you, was forever
I had a feeling I was made to feel all this time  
I had a feeling it was true and it nailed me
I had a feeling for which I had to abide

In the gleam of a glance, I’ll be in a trance
I’ll be so ignorant to 
The slippery truth, the slick of his wounds/slip of some words
Then there’ll be another man

I had a feeling ‘round you, it ensnared me      
I had a feeling I was made to feel all this time
A half feeling it was true and it nailed me
I had a feeling so bad that I almost went blind

Like the flip of a switch, the slip of his twitch will nullify the thing
In a moment I see reality and that’s all that it will take 
Cause with those eyes I know you lie, and that’s why

A bad feeling ‘bout you, was forever
I had a feeling I was made to feel all this time
A bad feeling ‘bout you, well whatever
I had a feeling I should leave while I’m behind

If love is to dare I’m bound to get bare
It will always be this way
With me the fool and you so cruel and that’s why I

Had a feeling ‘bout you
Had a feeling ‘bout you
Had a feeling ‘bout you
Had a feeling ‘bout you

You and Me Again

You and me we’ve been lucky
We’ve found out who we are
Before we die
That’s more then most can boast in their lives
I’ll never walk the line cause
I’ve got you on my side
I’ve been lucky this far in life
I’ll never see the sights
Cause I’ll be looking in your eyes
You and me again

A day can feel like forever
With nothing but music to play
A sad state of nothing
Fantasy scrawled on a page
But when I look in your eyes
The guitar subsides
It’s you and me again
I’ll never walk alone
Cause I’ll be marching to the beat of your drum
It will vanish all the misery and doubt
I feel a strange wind coming but I came through your door a huffing
You and me again

Our time is coming to be cradled in arms of steel
Cold winter nights are a blowing
It’s time to take cover for all of our lives
When the weakness comes I have you in my arms 
It’s you and me again
I’ve been alone before and there is loneliness certain to come
But for now when I look in your eyes
I’ll never walk alone
Cause you’ll be with me all along
You and me again
I’ll wander fields of darkness but I’ve got your light in my pocket
You and me again
You and me again
You and me again
You and me again
Be What I Want

Girls, the monthly mess
Boys, every day
Be what I want
Sing my favourite songs

Take care of it
Love, get out of it
Parties are boring
Girls, we get lonely

Be what I want
Sing my favourite songs

The Great Reward

My baby doesn’t work on Sundays
He heeds the great reward
Knowing that if we make it ‘til Wednesday
He will have freed himself
Of all he is and all that he ever was
Ring beautifully the chimes
Free of doubt free of the burden
We can see our growing up
What a mistake that was anyways
As we both grow we will slowly fade away
I can hear you talking

Later on when we come together
I can see so clearly now
Distinguishing ourselves from our enemies
Turned into creatures wild
When we both build up the courage
We look each other long
At all we are and all that we ever were
Fall silent for the song
And the miracle around us
Waking up when we are together
I want you knocking at my door
The miracle surrounds us

Lately I’ve been wallowing in the midst 
That of the great reward
Are we to blame or are there other men to suffer the great cause
Even though we’re worn to the bone 
We will spend the night listening to each other
Will it be love or will we blather on?
Spend the night it’s not a waste of all effort
That conversation once more

Later on when we’ve lost contact
There’ll be the faintest form
Remembering all that we came for
To see the great reward
Knowing us we’ll convince ourselves in the end
As just an imagined song
Even though we’re worn to the bone
We will spend the night listening to each other
Will it be love or will we blather on
Spend the night it’s not a waste of all effort
That conversation once more
The miracle surmounts us
I want you knocking at my door
The miracle survives us
I hear you knocking at my door
That conversation once more
Drunk Dancers’ Waltz

We’ve been gutted and bludgeoned beyond repair
Danced quite able Clark Gable beneath the stair
Fib and fable we cradle our own regret
Oh we blubber and stutter ‘til evening’s end

	No we won’t let the blood of our enemies cool
No we won’t let the blood of our fathers be cursed
No we won’t

We’ve been lovers and gluttons without a care
As we hang out and break out of our own snare
God or Goddess it’s obvious we need a drink
Have another vodka brother, will ease the pain

	No we won’t let the blood of our enemies cool
	No we won’t let the sons of our fathers be used
	No we won’t 
And you won’t have to wander the fields all of mud
	And you won’t have to squander each minute of lust
	No you won’t

Counting Stars

He walks and talks with me he knows my every thought 
If seeing is believing I’m sure we’ll be conceiving our own mirage
With every bit of being, the gate we will be meeting, we’ll be on time
A closed eye and a bended knee expecting a warm greeting but we’ll be denied

We’re counting stars like we’re all in heaven but they never even knew our names
Oh we shine like we’re all in heaven, but we ain’t
We’re counting stars like we’re all in heaven but they never even knew our names
Oh we shine like we’re all in heaven, but we ain’t

I know he must be lurking I know he must be watching my every move
But when I think about believing I think about deceiving everyone
I knew there was a problem when the pain it wasn’t stopping I felt the love
Or the hate it must have been because soon I was bleeding from every pore

We’re counting stars like we’re all in heaven but they never even knew our names
Oh we aspire to all go to heaven but we ain’t
We shine like we’re all in heaven but they never even knew our names
Oh we shine like we’re all ascending but we ain’t

You’ll play the pig and I’ll play drunk
You play fetal and I’ll play the drum

We’re counting stars like we’re all in heaven but they never even got our names
Oh we shine like we’re all in heaven but we ain’t
We’re counting stars like we’re all in heaven but they never even knew our names
Oh we aspire to all go to heaven but we ain’t
We shine like we’re all in heaven but they never even knew our names
We shine like we’re ascending, but we ain’t

Twilight of the Season

In the twilight of the season and the miracle that brings, goodbye
Take a chance on this stuff, you will be lured by it, you will be warned this time
Though the past is up, it’s aching to convince itself its spring, good luck
Take a chance, although, you’ve been stung and your day has come, goodbye
When the day it turns to darkness and the waves lay still in ice, goodbye
Take a chance on this one, I will belong to it, I will be tied this time

I’m not used to this running around
Looking for clues with my head in the ground

The overflowing ocean, we will slip into the mud, goodbye
Make the best of what I got, we will return to where we have come, goodbye
The violence of this feeling is a never-ending flood, goodbye
There’s no time like this night to take it all, to take what is mine, goodbye
And since there’s no way then to fight it and the horsemen have their way, goodbye
I’ll take a chance on something else, but will be dragged by it, and will be dropped this time, this time. 

I’m not used to this running around
Looking for clues with my head in ground
I’m not used this running around
Looking for clues with my head in the ground

The end of love is fatal, we will stick it to them all, goodbye
I’ll take a chance on something else, give what I got, give it all, goodbye
In the twilight of the season and the miracle that brings goodbye
I’ll take a chance, it’s all I got, we will go softly, and we will go blind
goodbye, goodbye



The Mild Mannered Army

The Mild Mannered Army combats the bitterness inside of me
Melting my gun, two become one
The orders from the officers benefit all of the soldiers
We train and we sweat and soon become vets

Hated and wasted but why?
No good reason to save them cause they can save us all
They’ve taken all these measures to sever their cause
But they don’t need a cure they need a war

The Mild Mannered Army incites a regular group orgy
Gun against gun, flesh within bum
Designed and taught to draw blood but the sword is also phallic
There are choices to kill and choices to fill

Commit an act of murder to further the war
They stand a chance to fight the enemy boys with love
Hated and wasted but why?
No good reason to fear them just cheer them on

I’d risk my life for the army
A P.O.W. for eternity
Prison is fun when my army has won

We’ve taken all these measures to sever their cause
They don’t need a cure they need a war

Meeting in the sauna we rub down each other
Peace can beget from buggery I bet


High Upon the Church Grounds

I get high on the church grounds
The wind in my hair the sun over head
On a bench or behind the stairs

We get high on the church grounds
The men of cloth stay in their candle-lit box
As we unleash hell

I love the sunny days and our mortal decay
As we watch the church crumble away
I have one hand on my heart 
And one hand in the dark
As I search the room throbbing for you

The drugs get dealt and the cocks get felt 
on the church grounds
The saints over my head defend the innocent 
and the weak of heart

I get high when I hear the church bells
The ringing leads me to repeat its meaning 
and then to song

The song I want is long
And it moves around and about
It has a voice singing and a guitar ringing
A fabled song

We stand high on the church grounds
Holding instruments we call infinite
Play the strangest song

The strange song has drums
And bombs blowing up and about
The saints over my head
Bring a song to an end as they sing along



Ratify the New

Cease the design
Halt the line
Burn all the news
Break the ice
Like the death of his muse
Ratify the new

Lead me to light
Calm my fright
Forget what you know
Leave your old

Say in your own words 
What you’ve heard 
And what you’ve seen with your own eyes
Canonize the truth
Like the death of he who knows
Ratify the new
Ratify the new
Ratify the new

Look into my eyes
Harmonize
Paths you will go
Let no one know
Like the death of he who’s born
Ratify the new
Ratify the new
Ratify the new





In the NA

Loose my step
Wash my back
Hypnotized
Hold me close
Incomplete
Could I be less?
Hold my hand 
Watch my back

Then I wouldn’t need a single NA, to take each NA as my own. No I wouldn’t need a single thing, higher then anyone, I’d be staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.

Animal
Holy Ghost
I take control
Don’t hold me back
Chemical
Won’t be late
In the NA will be my fate

Then I wouldn’t feel the need to NA, if I was tired and used to all, no I wouldn’t have a single thought, free from any MA or BA, staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.

State my name
Will not complain
In the name
Hold me close
Want my day
Take all the blame
We’ll marry one day
And close the gate

Then I wouldn’t be the only one, to delve into the sea of NA, no I wouldn’t have a single thought, free from any MA or BA, I’d be staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.

He Falls to Me
He … … . 
Falls … … .
To … … .
Me … … .

He’ll be the first one
Forming alliance
Falling, unable
Fortify our power 
We’ll ride like horses 
on the horizon
Menacing eyeballs
Fortitude gallop 

In someone’s head in someone’s bed

They’ll keep arriving
Apples and oranges
Gobbling the last dregs  
Mouth full of foul age
Brim forth eternal
Day of doom coming
From the cathedral
Office is crumbling
Calling to arm us
Armed with our sabers
Nail in the coffin
Televised newscast
Of his great blunder
All is forgiven
Building our houses
Closer together

In someone’s head in someone’s bed

He … … .
Falls … … .
To … … .
Me … … .
Colour of a man

Colour of a man chiseled in stone
Is the marker of a man ridded by woe
It is the colour of a man stuck in his grey
And the mood of his brood that he has painted on
His face is painted on with pools of clay
And the blood of an animal run astray
He is the colour of a man who plays in sport
And the wisdom of his words are simply taken on

He covers me with ash and falls asleep
I’m whispering the words that he has grown to love
Words can have a way to pull the string
A grunting of the “ifs” and “fs” and then the “oh”
It is simpler when I think about being no more then one of his many trophies
Then to live with a man who craves the cold
And to be the one that has to ask for every dole

Stone men stand as if they own the place
The power that they lack it has been painted on
Worshipping them is the only way
Creating worth from ash that greys the every pore
Is colouring the man with what he thinks he knows
The colour is infectious like the na ne nee ne na nee oh

I feel the weakness of his wishy-washy ways
In the rhythm of his hips as he pretends to love
And the heavy set of steps that stomp away
That is the colour of a manimalnimanimalnimanimalnimanimal
Do I Belong

Waking up with you beside me 
How can I go wrong?
Wasting my time ain’t too much bother
I’ll be like a dog
You’ve been wasting your time with your crystal ball
I’ll be with my guitar
Will be the end to all your trouble
I declare the law

But do I belong? 
Do I?

You could take it on up with our big father
I doubt if he’d give it a thought
He’ll be at home standing in a corner,
Wondering where he belongs, well do I boy!

Do I belong?
Do I belong?

Waiting all day by the telephone
Wondering if you’re going to call
I’ll go out to my friends’ party
Wondering if I belong, well do I??

Do I Belong?
Do I belong?
Do I? 
Do I?
Do I?
 

Walk On
Hey there baby don’t you know
That if you cry, cry, cry, well it won’t do much
Who’s been there right from the start?
Who’s going to love you when you are old?

Defeated in the night, walk on, walk on
I can see you in the night, walk on, walk on

Don’t you think that you ain’t been warned
You’ll have to find your way home all alone
Walk the streets where you’re not known
Crawl, crawl, crawl out of your hole

	Conceived in the night, walk on, walk on
I can see you in the night, walk on, walk on

Hey there baby, don’t you cry
If I “ra, ra, ra” Am I the rabid one?
Don’t you say you ain’t been warned
You’ll have to make the best of every mess in your life

I see you in the night, walk on, walk on
Conceived in the night, walk on, walk on
Defeated in the night, walk on walk on
I can see you in the night, walk on, walk on
I can see you in the night, walk on, walk on




Kingdome Come

Does he come today or do I wait and wait for him to come?
I might be lost but he is on the way.
Am I a slave to desire being caged by his arms and his own reflection? 
It might just be my only hope this spring.

(Realize that I’m young and I’m hoping for additional luck and there’s nothing that I would rather want to be than hopeless.)

May I be caned if I’m not able to abstain from the evil of Kingdome Come, the mark it leaves will be the noblest thing.
Will I be lewd to the dude and crude to his prude and to his profession?
It might just be my only time to scream and to

	(Realize that I’m caught in a motion of habitual want
Then emotion occurs with all luck in a moment)

Does he come today or do I wait and wait for him to come?
I might be lost but he is on the way.
And when he comes, if he comes, will he have the key to the lock of Kingdom Come? I’ve likely always been lost at sea.




Origin:Orphan

Who in the world put me here to be all on my own?
Who in the world would be here if he wasn’t a whore?
A whore when he sleeps
A whore when he dreams

Who would I be in the world if I wasn’t born
A whore when he weeps
A whore when he thinks
Who in the world will I blame for my tired woe
As the sun secedes
A day less to be
Who put the will and the fright in my bones to go on?
The goal is achieved
My role convenes
Eat and I eat and I eat and I eat to go on
A whore when he feeds 
A whore when he thinks

Who in the world put me here to be all on my own?
A whore when he speaks
A whore when he thinks

Who in the world would I be if I wasn’t born?




Underage

Lets do it like we’re underage, that’s the way to be
Prey on the illusion that will be the death of me
The day I saw people that’s when I have seen that
you grew out of everything that you could ever be

So let’s like we’re underage, maybe I will play
Take me to the place where there ain’t a lot to say
You’ll pretend I’m seven I’ll pretend you’re eight
We’ll never take the time to stop and contemplate

Do it like we’re underage, that’s when I’ll be saved
We’ll be the only ones to make this glorious mistake
And when we’re dead and cart away that’s when I will say that
you have the most beautiful young thing I’ve ever seen

Do it like the underage
Do it like the underage
The Little Bit

I used to make through with the image of you
A little bit of heaven and a little bit of hell
We could start a family, being what we used to be
A little bit of tenderness a little bit of tough

Am I to blame for the advent of pain, dear? 
A little bit of amity a little bit of lust
I’ll suck the venom from your skin but you won’t let me in
A little bit of spittle and a little bit of blood
	
The little bit from each we mix it may be taking on
	But the little bit that doesn’t is the bit I need the most

Why am I the only one to do anything about it?
A little bit of tumbling a little bit of a thud
I’m feeling for a pulse, but the skin has gone all cold
A little bit of tragedy a little bit of trumpet

I ain’t a doctor or a medic but I’ll make an operatic of it
A little bit of trebling a little bit of trill
You’re getting older and I’m getting older yet
Use me, pull me anywhere you please
 
It’s the flicker of a grin that brings me back to you again
A little bit of levity a little bit of trouble
If I look away will it slowly slip into nothing
A little bit of air a little bit of mud

The little bit, you giving it, it may not be enough but
The little bit you holding it, it keeps me hanging on

I fill my belly everyday just to keep my beat going
A little bit of “in” and a little bit of “out”
If I ain’t the enemy then who am I anyway
A little bit of heaven and a little bit of hell

The little bit I have to give, I give it all up	
	The little bit you keeping, that’s what I’ve been thinking of
Silence can be a Headline
The world, full of chatter 
Turns against its will
As dusk turns into twilight
Its wish begins to wax
The axis slowly screeches
And halts, as the great whine
Fades into a whisper and 
Wipes the smirk off his face
Silence and the moonlight
Will idle here forever
Silence
He winced, what was to follow
Was in his own lament
He gave next to nothing
Got little in return
Silence can be forgiven
My eyelids can close forever
Silence, all is forgiven
Then a peep turned into moaning
And grew still into rave
And roving we came to nothing
But found a word to please
Silence in all countries, we’ll idle all together
Silence can be a headline for you and me
Silence all is forgiven
We’ll idle here forever
For you and me
For you and me
For you and me
For you and me




Skin & Leather

Men: tous les même
Men: tous les même
You pick me up and carry me home
 I’m pushed to the floor and I regain your trust
Lay on your wall I bleed on your rug
The word is “skin” and “bone,” they are the same
My wish to break the hold of the leather flood disappears as I moan:
“you are the same
you are the same
you are the same
you are the same”

You tighten up your hold to the beat of a drum
Drum made from skin and bone played with a tickle of feather
The word is “skin” and “bone” and I regain your trust
Repeat words “skin” and “bone” they are the same
I’ll be your skin and bone and your leather clone
Pain disappears as I moan for your skin and leather 
Skin and leather
You’re my warmth and pleasure
I’ll be your skin and leather

A lick of the floor is the end of it all
I dampen my robe as you darken the door
A clap of the bone is a plea for more
Condition a must, the word is ‘nough
I’m going to rub the rope when the rug is washed
And lay on your wall, with a hint of tether
I’ll be your skin and leather, 
Skin and leather
I’ll be your skin and leather
I’ll be your skin and bone on the telephone 
Pain disappears as I moan 
“you are the same”


Bread for Brat

Bread for brat
And tit for tat
Paddy-whack
On the brink of black
Face the fact
He wasn’t worth a scrap

As you want 
Take the rattle away
Holding onto nothing
He keeps shaking away

Bread for brat
He wasn’t bred for that
I’ll get the bread for brat
And half the half
Before he knows he’s had
Quit the chit chat
And swallow it back
To be done with that

As you want
We’ll dig our ditch
Fall into illusion
To the sound of our sniffs
He’ll be lost 
Outside of his pen
The tired institutions cannot bear the brunt of his ache

Bread for brat
Bread for brat
Gay Goth Scene

Doom

We can’t escape
Nor we dare attempt a coup
We’re given chips
But we don’t feel too rich
With iron hips
We deploy our own dance
It’s our own escape
And we hope to please the men
We change our names
But we don’t know the meaning for
Our own mistakes
We are called by words that stink
A deal is made
But it means we are free from harm

We are in love with the arms that bound our bones
	We plead for water and a treat

We fool ourselves 
Into thinking this is happiness
We hold the hurt
To our breast
Malicious words
Become the ointment on our skin
The sky is blue
But the blindfold gives us black
Black we embrace because we know we are doomed
We have bills to pay
And parties to attend
But all we do:
We inhale the dirt and fart

We are in love with the bars that take us into the dark
  	He spoke a charm that is the oil for tomorrow
Our patience is who we are


Afterparty

‘Neath the wind 
Blown away
Had I known
I would have fled
Through the park
Down the lane
Many eyes
Mine knee to nape
You don’t, you don’t 
You need to follow, who, someone that’s not you
You need to find someone that’s not right
That’s all there is, is the afterparty
That’s all there is, is the afterparty
That’s all there is, is petty cash
That’s all there is, the pressure
The pleasure
The pressure
The pleasure
We carry on
Through the blaze
Find the guy
Who has a place
You need to feel someone that’s not real
And you need to find someone’s that’s not right
That’s all there is, is the afterparty
That’s all there is, is the afterparty
That’s all there is, is pocket cash
That’s all there is, the pressure
The pleasure
The pressure
The pleasure


Carpe Jugular

When you stepped out on the floor you didn’t falter
I didn’t mean what I said, I was improper
Who taught you all that stuff? Who gives your orders?
I don’t know what you expect I’m not your daughter
You leave nothing on
You keep coming on 
The autonomy of man
Slow to understand the natural order  
You leave nothing on
You keep coming on
Though I beg inside for more I keep it under
Why don’t we cut all the crap and start it over
You kind of look like me, could be my brother
You tending to me you just like a mother
I couldn’t bother
I want your friend he wants another
Lo and behold the natural order
I’m doing my damn best to keep it under
One to another
When I think about where I’ve been and where I’m going
It may be neither
Before the night’s out
You keep coming on
You leave nothing on
You leave nothing on





Ordinary over you

Take thine arms, 
They be ordinary around you
Feign desire,
It be ordinary over you
Respect to the man I find
He be ordinary over you
If I cannot find
I’ll be ordinary over you

Spade and find
He be ordinary overused
If I cannot find
I’ll be ordinary over you
Lay with man and find
He be ordinary over you
Tame the man, in spite
He be ordinary over you


















Year of the Spawn

Thrown down year of the spawn
As two colors form another of lower hue
	Thrown down and so I was born

Flown down before I could run
As all the lovers they all were bludgeoned by the brutes  
Thrown down then I was stoned

Running down the road, reeling down the road
Reeling down the road, running down the road

Thrown down year war was won
And the mothers had all been plundered by the youths
Thrown down and so I was born

Running down the road, reeling down the road
Reeling down the road, running down the road

Thrown down 2001
As the colonist spits and mutters like a fool
Thrown down and then I was born

Running down the road, reeling down the road
Reeling down the road, running down the road
