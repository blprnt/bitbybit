gnaw his bones
Fear her not
divided
let it be
traitorous
Could I be less?
take your way
Call her forth

[Then I wouldn’t need a single NA, to take each NA as my own. No I wouldn’t need a single thing, higher then anyone, I’d be staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.]

PERSONAL
not Montague
I tell thee
God keep me so
innocent
I be old
[In the NA will be my fate]

[Then I wouldn’t feel the need to NA, if I was tired and used to all, no I wouldn’t have a single thought, free from any MA or BA, staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.]

Grace my sons
will not do
fof the land
Pray you come
have my flesh
Hang all the husbands
I come one way
and shake the orb

[Then I wouldn’t be the only one, to delve into the sea of NA, no I wouldn’t have a single thought, free from any MA or BA, I’d be staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.]
