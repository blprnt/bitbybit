see his face
hold his head
expected
let me speak
general
Could I be less?
meet his doom
see my back

[Then I wouldn’t need a single NA, to take each NA as my own. No I wouldn’t need a single thing, higher then anyone, I’d be staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.]

Pacific
ever I
God help thee
I know him not
infernal
I look deep
[In the NA will be my fate]

[Then I wouldn’t feel the need to NA, if I was tired and used to all, no I wouldn’t have a single thought, free from any MA or BA, staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.]

Man my boat
would not scare
of the whale
be it said
have his way
be all the things
We’ll marry one day
hear the thunder

[Then I wouldn’t be the only one, to delve into the sea of NA, no I wouldn’t have a single thought, free from any MA or BA, I’d be staring at the ground with my head in the clouds.]
